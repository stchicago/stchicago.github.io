<p>When sports and social/cultural norms intersect, it can make for some impacting results. Jackie Robinson broke the color line through athletic achievement, but his path was partly paved by earlier efforts. Jesse Owens' gold in 1936 Berlin,  proved any ethnic line could be crossed.  And similarly, when Jason Collins came out a few weeks ago, sports and culture collided once again, as bravely became the first openly gay male athlete still competing in an American professional team sports. The path he took however, was partly paved by others.</p>
<p><b>Praises Due</b></p>
<p>Before Collins bravely faced the press, there was Martina Navratilova. While she differed from Collins in that she was competing in an individual sport, and she competed at a much higher level in her field, she still had to worry about being stalked by homophobic fans and rival supporters. Sure Navratilova didn't have to deal with the dreaded "locker room" scenario of showering with straight teammates, but when she came out in 1981, she was only 24, and acted against the wishes of her employer, the Womens' Tennis Association. The NBA oppositely, encouraged Collins. Navratilova was also just nine days away from her court hearing to become a U.S. citizen. Seeking political asylum from the Communist Czechoslovakian government of the time, she was determined to live her life openly in her new homeland. That lifestyle however, was hardly in sync with the norms of American society in the early 80's.</p>
<p>Unlike now, the majority of Americans, including President Reagan, favored marriage inequality when Navratilova came out. There were not many straight athletes allying themselves with gay rights, and Jack Tripper was the closest you could get to a gay character in a sitcom. Perhaps most devastating of all, AIDS was joked about and targeted as a gay's only disease. Also, unlike Collins when he came out, Navratilova was in the prime of her career, and as a major superstar, stood to pay a considerable endorsement price for her open declaration of sexual preference. Navratilova's struggles however, have opened the doors of tolerance in some professional sports as evidenced by the scarcely noticed coming out of basketball phenom Britney Griner on the eve of her draft selection.  George Stephanapolous didn't try and get Briner on his Sunday show, but Jason Collins, bam! To his credit, Collins acknowledged the role Navratilova played in his ability to come out, telling Sports Illustrated's Jon Wertheim that "[t]he words thank you aren't enough."</p>
<p><b>He Needs a Brave GM</b></p>
<p>As he is not in the prime of his career, Jason Collin's basketball future is now dependent on his 34 year old body holding up in a young man's game, and a team willing to take the somewhat radical step of signing the first openly gay male professional athlete. As the GM of a team, it may intriguing or problematic to sign Collins. Inking a deal with Jason now is different then previous off seasons. It may not be Tebow size, but there will be heavy media crush paying close attention to any team that signs him, and asking all sorts of question that having little to do with basketball. Players could also be asked questions that they feel embarrassed about, or may not be prepared to answer maturely or respectfully. And sadly, by signing Collins, a GM will be exciting many fans, but may also be upsetting many others.</p>
<p>The flip side is that any GM that does sign Collins gets to be the Branch Rickey of the NBA. Corporate sponsorship opportunities will certainly present themselves, and any gay NBA fans who don't have a home team will follow the team with Collins. In markets like Miami, New York, and Golden State, Collins signing could be met with a great deal of postivity. Signing in Oklahoma City for example, or Memphis, may create a greater challenge. Would your team sign him?</p>
<p>That being said, Collins’ decision to come out likely reflects the more tolerant nature of contemporary society. Collins is going to be regarded in the future not just for being the first gay player, but as the player who gave the opportunity to younger gay players to feel more confident about coming out earlier in their careers. Some fans and players may be intolerant, but ultimately, if Collins can still ball at a high level, teams who need a big reserve will have a harder time explaining why they didn't sign him, instead of why they did.</p>
