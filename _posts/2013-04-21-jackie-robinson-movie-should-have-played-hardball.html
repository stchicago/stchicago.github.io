<p>"42," the new film telling of Jackie Robinson’s first year with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947 may be an entertaining effort, but it's immediately flawed by the PG-13 rating. The rating will force the film to cover up the bruises and cuts of racism that stung Robinson and other black ball players. The PG-13 rating foretells an uninspired and inaccurate narration of what Jackie went through. The great hero that Jackie became following his integrating baseball was not whom he was recognized as in his first year. His first game was met with no fanfare other than racist hecklers. Despite scoring the winning run in the seventh inning, Robinson's feat didn't make the front-pages of the The New York Times. Only later was his breaking the color line seen as the catalyst for the Civil Rights. Following Robinson's first year, President Truman proceeded with integration of the military, and seven years later, the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed school segregation. Martin Luther King Jr. called Robinson an original freedom rider for the endurance of his difficult struggle to find acceptance among whites.</p>
<p>A movie about Jackie Robinson's life has to be rated R, or NC-17. Before getting to his historic first year in the big leagues, let's start with his childhood in Cairo, Georgia. His father was a sharecropper, and like many other sharecroppers, was forced into a life of almost certain poverty. At a young age his father left the family, and he lived amongst racial discrimination of the Jim Crow South on the Jim Sasser plantation. Jackie's mother was rescued by her family in Pasadena, California, and she was able to move the family West.</p>
<p><b>Just Getting There was Tough Enough</b></p>
<p>Robinson's mother, Malllie, raised the family in Pasadena, Calif., where she washed and ironed for meager wages. Jackie watched his mother sweat to the bone, and dealt with typical race relations of the day like having to watch crosses burning on his front lawn. Watching the stoicism his mom displayed in dealing with such incidents of racism left a strong impression on Jackie however. She taught him how to brush racism off his shoulders, and in doing so, even endeared herself to some of their white neighbors. In doing so, she opened up the doorways for her son to display his color-blind athleticism amongst the other white kids in playground sports. Jackie even joined a gang, called the Pepper Street Gang, and challenged other gangs in football for money. Toughened up by bouts with the police, and these intense sporting conflicts for money, Jackie became a stud athlete. Perhaps most significantly of all, Jackie watched his older brother finish as the silver medalist in '36 to Jesse Owens, only to be treated as a nobody once he returned. An African-American, Jackie learned, can't even catch a break by winning the Silver medal in the Olympics.</p>
<p>Life before he started playing sports was hard on Jackie, but the kids he went up against in competition always made sure he never had it easy. Robinson had to go through football games and practices where his own teammates, and the opposition, got to take a lick on him every time he touched the ball. He was the running back, so he pretty much caught full-on assaults for eight straight years. You think the Bears and Packers hate each other, you should see how the integration of football played out around the country.</p>
<p>In his final high school game, after the whistle had blown the first play dead, a player from rival Muir, threw Jackie to the groun, breaking both Robinson's ribs. Robinson's major college hopes were dashed, and only through the hard work of his family, was he able to play at Pasadena Junior College where he earned his way back to elite football level to get attention from UCLA. Indeed, while playing football at Pasadena in 1937, Jackie decided to play baseball for the college, and as such, got to play against the mighty Chicago White Sox who took their spring training in Pasadena. White Sox manager Jimmy Dykes said at the time that if Robinson were white, the Sox would sign him.</p>
<p>Five years later, in 1942, Robinson was drafted into the Army. He was shipped to Fort Riley, Kansas. There, he applied to the Officers' Candidate School, and he, like other black candidates, were not allowed into the program.  However, with the help of world heavyweight champion boxer Joe Louis, who was also stationed at Fort Riley, Robinson was able to successfully petition for the right to attend the school. Robinson was eventually commissioned a second lieutenant in 1943. Robinson's feats began to represent the will and strong backbone of blacks whom were beginning to make stronger pushes for racial justice in America.</p>
<p><b>Breaking the Major League Color Line</b></p>
<p><b> </b>Following World War II, Robinson was signed by the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues. Robinson played well with Monarchs, finishing first in batting average. He got a spot in the Negro League's all-star game where he was closely watched by baseball scouts sent by Branch Rickey. Rickey, the president of the Brooklyn Dodgers, was evangelically determined to break Major League's color line. He had spent some time searching for the ideal candidate, and soon saw Robinson as his guy. He especially liked that Robinson was talented, smart and did not drink. Furthermore, thanks to his time in Pasadena and college, had played alongside whites before. According to Rickey's grandson, when a journalist asked Rickey if he thought “all hell would break loose” when Robinson took the field for the first time, Rickey answered, "I believe tomorrow all heaven will rejoice."</p>
<p>Robinson didn't need Rickey to tell him there would be difficult times, and he was tested in difficult ways right from the beginning. There is no way you could consider the things people in the crowds would yell at him as PG-13. To do history justice, this movie needs an R rating to accurately portray the type of society Robinson was living in. The words and jeers Robinson received  alone deserve the R rating, but he was also assaulted, with things being thrown at him, as well as he and his family receiving death threats.  All this was in first year, and even some of his teammates objected to his being on the team.</p>
<p>That Jackie Robinson succeeded in getting past the prejudice and racial strife is a story worth telling. But that prejudice and racial strife should not be cleaned up into a cookie cutter retelling that makes the post-WW II American racial divide seem like anything other than a hellacious time for American blacks. The things Jackie Robinson went through are as scary as any horror movie, and as shocking as any adult thriller. Accordingly, the retelling of his life needs to be rated R.</p>
