<p>In the horrible aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing, and the 24 hour fugitive escape four days later, Republican senators, led by Lindsey Graham, S.C., John McCain, Ariz., and Kelly Ayotte, N.H., tried to check some of the Constiution's power by suggesting that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 19-year-old suspect, a U.S. citizen, was not a "common criminal." Instead they suggested he was a "candidate for enemy combatant status." A press release detailing the reasoning the three senators gave for not allowing our strong criminal justice system to handle this already weakened criminal stated that "[i]t is clear the events we have seen over the past few days in Boston were an attempt to kill American citizens and terrorize a major American city."  The statement continued, "the accused perpetrators of these acts were not common criminals attempting to profit from a criminal enterprise, but terrorists trying to injure, maim and kill innocent Americans."</p>
<p>The senators are right about Dzhokhar Tsarnaev having committed acts of terror, but an American terrorizing other Americans is not terrorism under military jurisdiction, it is called — <em>committing a crime</em>. After all, couldn't any parent of the Newtown tragedy, or Columbine term the American citizen killers of their children as "not common criminals attempting to profit from a criminal enterprise, but terrorists trying to injure, maim and kill innocent Americans?"</p>
<p>If Tsarnaev were given enemy combatant status instead of his fair day in court, he could be tried in a military tribunal and the proceedings would be controlled to a greater degree. Think Guantanamo. This status would allow the FBI to invoke a public safety exemption to standard criminal procedures and go unconstitutional on his ass. The forgoing of these constitutional rights would be justified by the public's interest and need to know about any remaining active bombs or plots. For example, the authorities could question Tsarnaev without telling him that he had the right not to incriminate himself. They wouldn't have to tell him he had the right to an attorney for example, or the right to remain silent.</p>
<p>As it became apparent that the two brothers had acted alone, the feds were directed to read the surviving suspect his rights. They then charged him with heinous crimes in the presence of his court appointed lawyer. If Tsarnaev is convicted in federal court, which he will certainly be, he will be sentenced to death or spend the rest of life in prison. Is there any worse punishment that is constitutional? Those constitutional limits, as meager as they be sometimes, are the difference between acting right and wrong.</p>
<p><strong>An Easy Choice</strong></p>
<p>On days when it is not perpetuating the Drug War or the Drone War, the White House is capably led by a former constitutional law professor from the University of Chicago. Such an academic background likely prepared Obama to quickly quell this debate by saying that Tsarnaev will not be treated as an enemy combatant, rather as the citizen he is.  The president also pointed out that under U.S. law, United States citizens cannot be tried in military commissions.</p>
<p>The President's choice was probably easy for him. Nonetheless, he deserves credit for making the right decision. Treating a U.S. citizen as an "enemy combatant" destroys our criminal justice system because any violent criminal could rightly be seen as an enemy combatant in the minds of friends and families of their victims. Tsarnaev made Obama look even better when he told agents that he and his brother were acting alone, independent of any foreign operatives. Furthermore, after Sandy Hook and Tuscon, Obama knows that to loved ones of the people killed and wounded in these crimes, they do feel like terrorism has been committed against them. Do you think former representative Gabrielle Giffords could make a convincing case that Jared Lee Loughner should qualify as an enemy combatant? Surly she could also argue that shooting indiscriminately in a crowded super market  with the intent to kill is not a common criminal enterprise, but merely an attempt to maim and kill innocent Americans.</p>
<p>A compelling argument could also be made against the jerk who shot the poor children at Sandy Hook, and their teachers. Is bombing an eight year old worse then shooting a six year old? To us, they all suck. Any time a U.S. citizen commits a crime which takes or severely maims a life, he or she has committed a crime against the country, and is thus, an enemy combatant. If you believe those shirts and newspapers that say "We are Boston," then you know that when you bleed, I bleed. We are Americans who know that the government can not possibly stop every crime against us citizens. Knowing that however, doesn't mean that we should encourage government to take legal shortcuts when it seems convenient.</p>
<p>Whether they intended to or not, Lindsey Graham, John McCain, and Kelly Ayotte proposed to aggressively weaken and punish law-abiding citizens by stripping away some of their rights to a fair trial should they ever be charged with committing a crime. Just like you're still an American when you travel to Canada, so too are you an American after you terrorize another American, all be it a completely shitty one who deserves to die or rot in jail.</p>
