<p>As the University of Kentucky and Louisiville Basketball programs can attest to, the state of Kentucky can produce some fine basketball players. The state also produces some great smokeable grass. Republican Senator Rand Paul thinks it might be time for us to be able to legally smoke it. Kentucky, as recently as 2009, was the nation’s fourth largest illegal producer of homegrown marijuana. The weed produced there however, is not the great problem, according to Rand Paul, it's the illegal trade of legal prescription drugs. The DEA has handed out as many as 181 months to  Kentuckians who were caught traveling from Ohio to Florida with obtained and filled prescriptions for oxycodone and other drugs.  Guilty of doing it just like Walgreen's, only wrapped really well in yesterday's newspaper and shipped inside a stuffed Disney toy.</p>
<p>2016 potential Republican presidential candidate Paul seemingly threw his hat in the ring for office by suggesting he would support legalizing marijuana. He reminded us that had George W., or Barack Obama been caught smoking marijuana as they did in their past, they "could have been put in jail for their drug use." Look what would have happened," said Paul, "it would have ruined their lives." We at Saint Chicago, in a nod to broad thinking on both sides of the aisle, agree with Paul. And, as a republican who supports states deciding the issue of marijuana legalization for themselves, we salute him for somewhat boldly proposing policy which will weaken the stranglehold that US drug policy has on decisions made by the states, especially in the current political context.</p>
<p><b>Marijuana is a Civil Right.</b></p>
<p>Supporters of gay marriage have long argued that having a good time, how you please, is a matter of liberty. Demonstrating the remarkable way the once  contentious issue of legal pot can be framed, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli recently told college students at the University of Virginia that he was "evolving" on marijuana legalization, just like President Obama has said his views on gay marriage had been evolving prior to his announcement that he supports equal marriage rights.  When asked about voters legalizing weed in Colorado and Washington last election cycle, Cuccinelli said he wasn't sure about Virginia’s future, but said he was watching Colorado and Washington closely.</p>
<p>Just like gay marriage, legal weed, over the past decade has picked up broader, bipartisan support for change. As the American arc towards progress is gradual, but persistent, we are not surprised that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is now supporting the legalization of hemp. He is joined by Oregon Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, as well as Paul. The bill they have cosponsored would allow Americans to grow hemp. While hemp is not the same as regular marijuana, namely it has much less THC, itis currently classified in the same category as heroin.</p>
<p>Opposition to médical marijuana, and legal marijuana as well, is also staring to look extreme and hypocritical. The 5th Amendment "The right of the people to be secure in their  persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated." For over and fifty years, this right was extended to weed smokers in the United States who had been encouraged to use the substance. Then, in in 1937, the Marihuana Tax Act was passed which prohibited the legal distribution of marijuana for non-medical purposes.</p>
<p><b>The Background is Always Interesting</b></p>
<p><b> </b>A brief recanting would read that in 1930, then Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon appointed his nephew by marriage Harry J. Anslinger, to direct the brand new Federal Bureau of Narcotics. At the time, Mellon made most of his money from Mellon Bank, and they were making boatloads of money off of their investments in the DuPont chemical company. The decade coming out of prohibition saw companies like DuPont and Monsanto radically transform themselves in the rapid embrace of plastics and synthetic fibbers.</p>
<p>Prior to this, hemp and other natural products were used and sourced for a great deal of applications which DuPont wished to replace with synthetic plastics. Plastic, is made from mineral, chemical, petroleum, and fossil fuel deposits. Companies have excelled at finding ways to use these harsh deposits to make all kinds of goods which used to be made from natural products like hemp.</p>
<p>Mellon and Dupont steered Anslinger to the papermill and newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst. Eliminating hemp would harm him none, and enrich him more. Spreading disinformation about hemp, he started referring to it in his vast publications as the Spanish sounding marijuana, a blatant attempt to increase his anti-Mexican sentiments. So, as Rand Paul supporters would probably agree, this is no no noble place to start.</p>
<p><b>Legal Weed is Mainstream Republican Idealogy</b></p>
<p>Rand Paul is not breaking new ground. His dad has been pushing a full legalization on all drugs for years. Newsweek wrote that way back in the 2010 election cycle, it wasn't Nancy Pelosi favoring legalized pot, but John Dennis, her Republican challenger. At one point on the campaign, Dennis had staffers alter his sign to have Rastafarian color scheme and a pot leaf. For real. Conservatives, like Grover Norquist, can also point to the fact that legalization touches on issues of national security and fiscal prudence. In other words, growing it in your basement is better then having it shipped from Mexico, and the slightest of hints that the mainstream position of America is that we are currently losing two wars, Afganistan, and the war on drugs.</p>
<p>Moving forward, it will be likely that more Republican lawmakers will either have a change of heart themselves, or follow the Rob Portman move of empathizing with their pot-smoking son or daughter in the support of legal pot.  Republicans can talk about the need to prioritize law-enforcement efforts and budgets in the recessionary economy, and the small government crowd gets to argue that if somebody is smoking or growing pot in their own house, then feds and local authorities should be busy worrying about other ways to  protect and serve.</p>
