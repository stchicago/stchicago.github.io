<p>This new game of thorny American politics is mind numbingly dull for those of us who wish for effective governance from our federal legislature. Instead, political posturing, especially with events that take place on foreign soil in the middle of the ongoing war against Middle East terrorism, prevents us from getting to the facts which really matter, and also weakens our credibility abroad. The Benghazi hearings should have been used to learn lessons about the tragic death of the four Americans killed in the line of duty, and to use those lessons to protect the lives of other staff at American embassies and international government facilities. Instead, it became a sideshow that has not shed more light on the suspected group or groups who carried out the attack, but has become rather, an opportunity for the GOP to take early 2016 pot shots at Hilary Clinton. So far, she seems unscathed. The Republicans on the other hand, are left backtracking.</p>
<p>Just yesterday, 2012 Republican Vice Presidential Candidate and current congressman Paul Ryan, exemplified the Republican's mixed stance on Libya. Ryan had been telling conservative radio hosts that he had "no doubts" about Obama's involvement in a cover up about Benghazi. When Fox News asked him however, whether he had any reason reason to believe the White House purposely misled the American people on Benghazi, Ryan could not answer affirmatively, and quietly told Chris Wallace he doesn't know how to answer the question.</p>
<p>Republicans have been spending so much time trying to create the Benghazi scandal when it wasn't there, that they even managed to mute the real scandal over the IRS snooping on the tea-party. Obama's poll-numbers have remained constant during these weeks of turmoil most likely due to the fact that our society is so polarized from previous GOP attack lines, that sides have already been drawn.</p>
<p>Americans are also getting weary of hearing about screw ups that didn't really happen. Many Americans with tools like Google, are now aware that ambassador Chris Stevens was not at an American Embassy when he was killed, but at a consulate. While embassies and consulates refer to government representations in foreign lands, any country will have only one American embassy, which is heavily fortified, while it may have multiple consulates in various cities that feature considerably less protection.</p>
<p>So, the attack in Benghazi was not an attack on an American Embassy, and, had it been an attack on an American embassy, it would only have been the third under Obama. According to <a href="http://stablenytimes.com/">Stablenytimes.com</a>, there have been two embassy attacks and 4 deaths under Obama, whereas under Bush there were eleven embassy attacks and 52 deaths. Democrats never made the incidents a political football, and thus, the public is only catching on to such attacks existing now.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, this Republican fear mongering on Benghazi is coming at a time when the party is publicly attempting to rebrand itself. It doesn't need old dogs playing old tricks. but the old dogs like Karl Rove, are playing old tricks. Through his American Crossroads super PAC, Rove is spending large chunks of change blasting Clinton on her handling of the Libya attack, without actually offering any proof of incompetence.</p>
<p>Some Republicans did urge restraint as they looked at the facts and realized that the tragic events at the consulate were largely under the discretion of the CIA. Additionally, the CIA was largely responsible for giving Susan Rice the false information about the possible relationship between the attack and a video which she used on the Sunday talk shows.</p>
<p>Republican and former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates told CBS that he would have handled Benghazi in a similar fashion to Obama. When asked if Hilary Clinton could be involved in a cover-up, Gates answered "no". Even Bill Kristol, a conservative's conservative told Fox News he "wishes the Republicans would just be quiet for a while and that the partisan Republican groups that are fundraising off [Benghazi] would be quiet."</p>
<p><b>Your New Look Republicans</b></p>
<p>The Republicans desire to tarnish Obama and Clinton with this incident also underlies the fact that Democrats are now the cold blooded drone killers, while the Republicans have become the party that is mainly concerned with stopping abortions and crying over the deaths of diplomats voluntarily serving in a conflict zone. Chris Stevens' death is a shame, but he is not the first diplomat killed in the line of duty, and he will not be the last.</p>
<p>By calling the events in Benghazi a scandal, the right has left themselves vulnerable to public scrutiny over conservative fiscal measures in the years of 2011 and 2012, when the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to remove nearly half a billion dollars from embassy and consulate security funding projects. Why didn't they fight so hard against Obama back then for making cuts to embassy security? Why wait for Stevens to die?</p>
<p>The new-look Republicans have taken the old line in the sand approach that says Obama either directly knew that the embassy was attacked by a coordinated strike and deliberately tried to hide that fact from the press, or that Secretary of State Hilary Clinton, failed to deal adequately with prioritizing our security efforts. If  politics happened in a court of law, this would amount to a whole bunch of allegations without any substantiation. But since our politicians get to make laws without really having to understand our legal system, they know that made-up scandals are almost as dangerous as real ones. For example, what happened to Jon McCain's black daughter? The sad truth is that once again, Republicans want Obama to fight against them for the American people, not with them.  For all of us, that song and dance should have ended after the 2012 elections.</p>
