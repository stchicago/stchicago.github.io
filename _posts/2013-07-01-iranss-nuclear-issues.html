<p>Two months ago, this post welcomed the appointment of Senator John Kerry as Secretary of State, and specifically called for the former Massachusetts Senator to begin courting a more diplomatic relationship with Iran. As he is in the Middle East this week, we hope he talks with leaders in the region about the recent victory of moderate Iranian Prime-minister Hassan Rowhani, which could and should offer the West more reason to feel encouraged about a more normal diplomatic relationship with Iran. Rowhani has intimated that his administration will feature more cooperation with the United States, such cooperation he said though, only comes if the US: allows Iran to continue through with its nuclear ambitions; stops interfering with Iranian internal affairs; and the US end its oppressive sanctions.</p>
<p>The sanctions have hurt the people in Iraq by crippling the economy and propping up the corrupt government, and also the Western economies which do business there. Sanctions have shrunk Iran's oil sales and have left the country isolated from international banking. Rohani, who is said to be one of Iran’s leading foreign policy experts, knows he has to take some initiatives that will change Iran's deepening isolation. Economic hardship, rising unemployment, a devalued currency and soaring inflation are making ordinary Iranians nervous, and hurting any big business willing to invest there. Both MTN and Sasol, two large South African multinationals with investments in Iran, have been seen crippling financial hits as a result of western sanctions imposed in response to Iran’s nuclear ambitions.</p>
<p>Iran's nuclear issues, and disastrous relationship to Israel, are the most significant obstacles to an improved relationship between the US and Iran. Yet, if under this new leader, Iran is willing to provide the world with open inspections of its nuclear facilities, the West must be able to trust Iran, and ease up on the sanctions. Earlier this week, Rohani said he would pursue moderate policies, including making the nation’s nuclear programme more transparent. However, he also said the US must recognise all the rights of the Islamic republic, including its nuclear rights.</p>
<p>Iran has the legal right to enrich uranium for under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or NPT, which has been enforced globally since 1970. Iran, while going about their nuclear business in a quiet, and rather salacious kind of way, has maintained that its enrichment program is part of a civilian nuclear energy program, allowable under Article IV of the NPT.</p>
<p>As illustrated by the large margin of Rohani's victory, many people in Iran are in favor of some issues of Westernization. He garnered more than 50 percent of the votes, over 18.5 million votes went to him. Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, Tehran's mayor, took second place with only 6 million. Accordingly, Rohani has said that will look to heal old wounds with the west.</p>
<p>To clean the wounds, Rohani will need to let more pro-Western voices be heard in and through Iran's government institutions, especially with respect to Nuclear power and Israel. He must be more transparent as he spearheads Iran's insistence on the continued development of nuclear power as a condition of better relations with the West. And while Iran's tensions with Israel are likely to remain for a while, Rohani the necessary hubris a leader in the region needs in order to stave off a war with Israel. Because any war with Iran would be horrible for us, Iran, Israel, and the world, we're going to have to suck it up and let Iran join the nuclear bullies in the lunchroom.</p>
<p>The Iran that is coming to the table now is probably feeling pretty good about itself. It is likely that the Iranian people, much like we did in 2009 following Obama's first Presidential victory, are basking in a sense of hope. When elections result in new leadership which is markedly different from the old, citizens tend to believe that the course of the country is changing for the better. Iran, like us in 2008, could use some good news, because at this point, Iran is suffering with double-digit unemployment, a high degree of government corruption, and a sluggish patronage laced economy.</p>
<p>These are enormous challenges for us and Iran, but our nations are not so dissimilar. Two-thirds of the adult population are college educated, and the pressures for socio-economic stability will be part of an upcoming push for reforms which allow more access to success. More then likely, any social gains Rohani makes could be checked by the conservative theological rulers. The Islamic Republic's policies on matters such as its nuclear program, and relations with the US  are decided by the Supreme Council, above the president's level. The Ayatollah Khamenei and his circle of advisers typically decide the direction of these policies, and the president carries them out.</p>
<p>Rohani's victory does not mean that Iran will change, but it does represent Iran's desire for a change in the way the rest of the world views the Iranian Republic. During his campaign, Mr. Rohani said the U.S. was similar to the world's "village elder,"  and someone that Iran should be talking with. How's that for some new diplomacy with Tehran?</p>
