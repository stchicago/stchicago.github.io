<p><img alt="Ban assault weapons" src="/images/ban-assault-weapons.png" />Today's post looks into the proposed Assault Weapons ban, and other congressional legislation geared to curb excessive gun violence. Let us start off by saying that while guns are great and no one is saying we should take them away, let us also agree that most Americans do favor some sort of controlling measures to try and prevent more mass shootings like those most recently in Arizona, Colorado, and Connecticut. According to polling in mid-February from Pew/USA Today, over 80 percent of Americans support  background checks on gun sales. The same poll also showed that over fifty percent of Americans favored the bans on assault style weapons and high-capacity clips as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, it is clear that politics, for whatever reason, is also clouding the debate. According to a January, 2013 Washington Post-ABC poll, Democrats support Obama’s gun control proposals 76 percent of the time, while 72 percent of Republicans do not. Independents who were polled voted 51% in favor of gun control. However, in the same poll, but prior to Obama putting his stamp on the newest proposed restrictions, 85% of Republicans supported requiring background checks at gun shows, 59 percent supported a ban on high-capacity clips. What that says is that there are still almost a quarter of the Republican party who don't hate Obama so much that they won't listen to an argument for one of his policy positions. The rest of the Republicans are letting a seemingly contrived grievance with the president get in their way of governing. After all, as the party who is supposed to be focused almost solely on keeping taxes down and the stock market high, they are awfully good at being awfully mad at President Obama for keeping the U.S. stock market at record high volumes, and taxes near historical lows.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gun control advocates repeatedly lean on the Second Amendment of the Constitution which states that "a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." The argument thus goes that the founding fathers wanted everyone to have a gun, just like Pras of the Fugees. However, gun control itself is not a modern contrivance, but goes back to the founding of the country. The Second Amendment is not, and likely was not meant to be, a libertarian license for everyone to have any gun at anytime they pleased. This assertion is supported by the fact that the founding fathers restricted large segments of the population from owning guns in ways that would make them out of touch with today’s NRA crowd. The obvious example that comes to mind is that slaves and free blacks were barred from having guns, and at times even law-abiding white men, like those unwilling to swear an oath of loyalty to the revolution. So, rather then having a history of gun liberalism, America's forefathers were actually quite conservative on the issue.</p>
<p>We turn now to the belief that the Second Amendment forbids the government to "infringe" upon any civilian's rights to "keep and bear arms." This belief is unfounded however. For, just as the First Amendment does not give us the right scream "fire" in a crowded theatre when there is no actual fire, the Second does not prevent the government from reasonably enacting regulations which would control how guns are made, dealt, and owned and possessed.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Justice Scalia, who wrote the majority opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller, a case which endorsed the idea that all Americans have the right to bear modern handheld weapons not invented at the time of the founding of the country. However, in a July, 2012 interview with Fox's Chris Wallace, Scalia, in response to a question about limitations, said "obviously, the amendment does not apply to arms that cannot be hand-carried. It’s to keep and bear. So, it doesn’t apply to cannons. But I suppose there are handheld rocket launchers that can bring down airplanes that will have to be–it will have to be decided." As Justice Scalia, and all of us now undoubtedly know, there are hand held weapons that allow a person to walk into a school and fire off 152 rounds in less then fifteen minutes by using magazines that can hold 30 bullets at a time. We shouldn't have to wait for another set of suits against the federal government.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In conclusion, we,  as do most sensible hunters, gun owners, and sport shooters know there is no way in hell all guns will ever have to be given up. But making a case to get rid of Bushmasters or the AR-15, the weapon used in the Batman, Aurora shooting, an eerily similar piece of equipment to the military’s M-16, is much easier and sensible to do. According to Pulitzer Prize winner and hunter Jon Meachem, these guns have "no sporting purpose save playacting, in which the shooter is in some kind of combat situation." We agree. To anyone whose idea of a good time is reenacting the Ice-T classic <em>Surviving the Game</em> with real ammunition and similar weaponry, we think you should take up tackle football or hockey. Either that, or take your impressive lobbying skills and finances, buy some territory in Canada or Mexico, and go live out your fantasy there. Finally, remember that even if you are only allowed to have a ten capacity magazine clip, you still got one in the chamber.</p>
