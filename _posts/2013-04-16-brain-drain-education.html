What's going on?</p>
<p>In cities such as Chicago, Saint Louis, New York City, and Philadelphia, large universities are partly responsible for taxpayers facing increasing property taxes despite plummeting home values. The responsibility lies in the fact that some universities, by purchasing additional properties in their area,  are taking large portions of taxable property off the municipal books. Nonprofits like the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) , or the University of Chicago do provide good jobs and useful services to their communities, but they also act as a burden on their respective cities. Their students and staff who live and work on campus, or in campus owned buildings, use public services like roads, and fire and safety without any of their tuition dollars going to pay for them. Many students who live off campus, are now choosing to live in school owned homes and buildings, meaning their landlord is not paying taxes either.</p>
<p>Schools are Going for the Land Grab</p>
<p>Penn owns so much land in Philly that the tension between locals and the school are high. Bumper stickers have been spotted around the city protesting Penn's propensity to describe every neighborhood they buy property in as "University City". The stickers read "This is West Philly, University City is a marketing scheme." Gentrification in Philadelphia is referred to as "Penntrification."</p>
<p>In University City, Missouri, where Washington University (Wash U.) is situated, the burden is weighing on both old and young taxpayers. New buyers are scared over rising taxes on properties that are worth less then half of what they were when John Kerry ran for President, and many older owners who are on a fixed retirement income, will no longer be able to afford to stay in their homes. Relief will be hard to come by because lawmakers and voters are hesitant to raise a lot of noise over the issue as the universities do create stable local jobs, especially high paying white collar positions.</p>
<p>Following Penn's lead, the University of Chicago has been buying up swaths of land in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago, Wash U. has been going nuts buying real estate in Saint Louis. It looks a little something like this: Wash U. puts forth a steady flow of capital into formerly downtrodden neighborhoods around the Delmar Loop; University City sees high values in rental and retail rates, jobs being created, and amenities being offered to their residents; and eventually the ugly topic of the effect the university improvements have on demographics with respect to race and class is raised. The subsequent discussion demands an answer as to whether private schools of higher learning are really civic benefactors who improve their neighborhoods, or are large private institutions accidentally acting as race and class manipulators.</p>
<p>PILOTS are not Enough to Fly the Plane</p>
<p>Some universities do make PILOT ( payments in lieu of taxes) contributions to their cities . Baltimore gets $5.4 million a year from PILOTs, and Boston is at $17.4 million. St. Louis, Chicago and Philadelphia do not seem to be bothered by the fairness notion, however.  Philly nonprofits contributed a measly $496,810.40 in 2011 PILOT payments, while St. Louis and Chicago institutions contributed nada. To make matters worse, Philly lawmakers know they are hurting the city because in the 1980s and ’90s, Philadelphia established a program through which larger nonprofit organizations like universities and the hospitals did pay a third of the property taxes due from a taxpaying organizations of similar size. Philadelphia collected $8.8 million in 1996 alone. While the Philly program is no longer in effect, it does provide other cities who suffer from lack of tax collection with a blueprint for managing a way to get their hands on millions of dollars each year.</p>
<p>Administrators will point to the fact that higher taxes on a university will lead to higher tuition rates. Accordingly, parents who are dolling out their savings, or students who are busting their butts serving dishes and dancing on poles to come up with tuition money, will not think of their respective universities as being a bargain. Despite all the noble educating going on in the hallowed halls, the modern university hardly seems like a storefront charity. Yet in the eyes of the IRS, they are. As such, they are exempt from paying property tax on their real estate. This authority comes from section 501-c-3 of the IRS tax code which provides that buildings used for education and health are tax exempt.</p>
<p>In Conclusion</p>
<p>PILOT programs can really help when they are exercised adequately, as in Boston, or Baltimore, but they are not the answer if stronger regulation does not accompany their operations. A 2010 study done by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy found that PILOTs, as currently structured and administered, do not deliver similar amounts of revenue to that which is lost to the nonprofits’ tax exemptions. Therefore, the revenue must be made up, and should not be shifted to local taxpayers, most of whom do not work for the schools. The mayor of Pittsburgh, Luke Ravenstahl once proposed something he called the "tuition tax." The tax was to have been a 1 percent tax on Pittsburgh based college tuition to help support city services. The plan would have added $16.2 million annually to his city. While Ravenstahl's initiative ultimately failed, we think the issue deserves more suggestions and proposals for ensuring that tax-exempt entities pay a reasonable portion of the metropolitan service costs will be highly valued by municipal governments.</p>
