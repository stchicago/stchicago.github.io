<p>The Associated Press had its main Twitter account hacked on the afternoon of April 23, 2013. The single hacked tweet which was sent out was a false news story that President Obama was injured in a White House explosion. The event unfavorably brought back memories of the “flash crash” of May 6, 2010. That day saw the stock market drop a 1,000 points in minutes. It did come back up a few minutes later, back up. The SEC investigation yielded that the crash was caused by an overtly large futures trade made by automated trading software.</p>
<p>Under new rules implemented after the 2010 crash, exchanges must stop trading in an individual stock for five minutes across U.S. stock markets when the stock experiences a 10% price or greater swing in the five-minute period  preceding the crash. Social Media outlets, which are monitored by big and small trading firms alike, already face complicated security challenges, and many are just learning how to come up with consistent rules to monitor the modern complexity and speed of computer trading systems. Social media hacking's ability to destabilize markets now presents another challenge, and perhaps, reminds us that machines sometimes make life faster, but when there's a problem, they can suck like sinus pain.</p>
<p><b>Another Twitter Attack Could Look Like This</b></p>
<p>We are going to invariably see markets dip from time to time because of a tweet. The reason for this is because of the computer programs which are designed to identify patterns through electronic algorithms. These algorithms are constantly monitoring social networks like Twitter the same way they do large corporate websites. These programs will refresh every few seconds, or faster to check these sites and networks for the newest information. On Twitter, an algorithm will look for trends, like a keyword that keeps popping up that's linked to a company. For example, if lots of tweets or retweets say that 500 people died at the ACME Chilli Company chilli cook off, it might be a sign that  ACME Chilli company was going to be in for rough times. If the trend happens fast enough, as was the case with the fake Obama tweet, the programs will react.</p>
<p><b>Too Quick for Rhyme and Reason</b></p>
<p>Immediately following the fake Obama tweet, there was a sharp drop in the U. S. stock market. The market rebounded just as quickly following news that the story had been false, but the event served as a reminder that the risks of relying on computerized labor, including trading. No important trader had time to make a basic phone call to confirm the news before the stock market fell. “And it wasn’t just the stock market. It was the bond market and commodity market and everything,” said Joseph Saluzzi, co-head of Themis Trading, an equity-trading firm . “The event," according to Saluzzi was done before humans could even process it.” Because computers play such a large part in the nearly 20 trillion dollar stock market, their power can not be left unchecked if long term stability is the market's essential goal.</p>
<p>The tweet which shocked the market read "Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured." Some who took it seriously can be forgiven because it was posted at 12:07 p.m. on the AP's official twitter account @AP. Upon posting, the tweet instantly got more than 3,000 retweets. The tweet caused the Dow Jones Industrial Average to fall more than 150 points. According to the Denver Post, in two minutes, the drop wiped out $136 billion from the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. After Jay Carney, Obama's press secretary, let the press know the president was safe, the market did return to normal levels.</p>
<p><b> Too Fast to Fail?</b></p>
<p>The fake tweet about Obama's attack impacted the market because trading firms will gather information in any place they can find it.  Traders monitor news channels, the Web, and use social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter to gain a price advantage over competition. The problem therein however, is that the markets depends on these companies ability to secure themselves.  This new news the comes from sources like Twitter is accompanies by now visible weaknesses such as that an official feed can be hacked, thereby triggering a rapid response in automated trading.</p>
<p>Thus the question becomes: is computerized trading too fast to fail? Can high-speed trading become the next Wall Street disaster the way that the banks have become? High-frequency trading is the constant moving of securities for tiny slivers of profit without being left with any product. The modern stock exchanges, according to Nick Bauman of <i>Mother Jones</i>, can execute trades in less than a half a millionth of a second—more than a million times faster than the human mind can make a decision. The current average holding period of a stock is five days. Less then fifty years ago, it was over five years. High-speed trading algorithms now responsible for over half the trading in the US. Computer orders are sent and canceled in mind benignly fast episodes in likely efforts to throw off the competition. Strategies like flooding the market with bogus trade orders to throw off competitors, or quick liquidations of large stock positions are common according to Bauman. Today's large scale trading therefore, depends not on how much the stock is worth, but how fast a trader can get rid of it.</p>
