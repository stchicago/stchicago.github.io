<p>Now that John Kerry has taken over for Hilary Clinton as Secretary of State,  he should start by shifting our policy positions towards Iran. Appointing Hilary to Secretary of State may have appeased the Democratic base in the US, but it did nothing for normalizing relations in the Middle East. Upon Clinton's departure, the Obama administration stands ready to do the real work towards bringing Iran in from the diplomatic cold. Iran has over 75 million college educated citizens, two-thirds of the world’s crude oil reserves, and should be allowed nuclear capability.</p>
<p>Though he's hardly a new Washington face, Kerry probably remembers back in 2008 when Obama spoke of hope that America would have diplomatic engagements with Iran rather then the cold unilateral financial sanctions against Iran imposed by President Bush. To bring Iran into the good diplomatic graces of the west, Kerry should advocate: formerly recognizing Iran; the lifting of the sanctions against Iran currently in place, and formerly declaring that military forces will not be the base of future conflict resolutions. With such an open door policy comes the ability to begin trade negotiations with the Iranians, as well as introduce foreign investors to local entrepreneurs. There is even a hand to be played by big American energy companies, who can also assist in expanding the Iranian oil industry.</p>
<p><b>Lift the Sanctions</b></p>
<p>First off, an open engagement with Iran, even an Iran with nuclear power, fits within the framework of past relationships between the U.S. relations and Iran.</p>
<p>After all, in 1953, President Eisenhower moved to subvert Iran's democratic regime led by Muhammad Mussadiq, who was gaining power against the regal Shah. The Shah, who was controlled by British oil interests and deep pockets, eventually fled to Rome before the CIA, and Britain's MI6's rolled in. The CIA then staged a Tehranian coup which brought down Mussadiq and restored the Shah. The Shah, with the blessing of Western Oil interests, would then began a quarter-century of political repression, torture, and killing. Naturally, these US acts left a deep impact on Iran, and should give us some patience for tolerating Iran's ambitions.</p>
<p>Secondly, an open relationship with Iran also serves the interest of strengthening international ties in the wider Middle East. Obama understands this, and in February of this year, he told Israeli's that Iranian relationships would be normalized. If Iran can be brought into the international diplomatic fold as a peaceful player, presumably by getting it to recognize Israel, it will remove Israel’s perpetual status as a victim of Iranian attacks.</p>
<p>Thirdly, for the United States, establishing peaceful ties with Iran will avoid a costly war with another Middle Eastern power. Instead of watching our brave men and women be wounded and killed, we can sit back and plan trips to what was formerly Persia. An open US/Iran relationship would likely diminish the perceived need for Iran to arm itself with nuclear weapons to protect themselves against Israel or the United States. American diplomatic involvement would also likely strengthen and grow the Iranian economy as well. Such a growing economy would also be welcomed as a friendly trading partner in the region.</p>
<p><b>Skeptical Ain't Great, but It's Better Then What We Got</b></p>
<p>Assuming that Turkey and Iraq will back us in talking with Iran, the US will need Turkish assistance in the region. Following the flotilla incident of 2010, when Israeli soliders attacked and killed nine Turkish requested three conditions from Israel: an official apology; compensation for people killed during that attack; and, Turkey wanted an end the blockade on Gaza. Things appeared dicey between the two nations, and Turkey even froze military agreements. However, money kept moving because trade, and some tourism continued. Some Turks, like some Arabs,  have started comparing Zionism with fascism, but then, something interesting happened. With Obama present, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, by phone, officially apologized to the Turkish Prime Minister. Netanyahu also; agreed to pay  for the those killed during the attack; and  partially lift the blockade on Gaza for consumer goods. Netanyahu's ability to swallow some humble pie, and promise to lift the siege is hard to believe for many Arabs, but their skeptical nature sure beats the unmitigated hatred they have for the sanctions. especially many Arabs are quite skeptical.</p>
<p>If Iran's feat of being addressed by the US is met with as much aplomb as Israel's apology was in Turkey, the Iranians' will see it as a diplomatic victory. Obama has spoked of this grander vision of the Middle East before, now he just has half as much time left to make it a reality. In talking with Iran, Obama can ask Iranian leaders to think of their own legacies. President Ahmadinejad of Iran, could have something that the Supreme Leader of Iran does not, a real role in improving his country’s society. If Achmadinejad greets Obama with openess, and vice verse, then we will eventually get the support of the Iranian people the anti-American rhetoric of the current leadership if we took this route.</p>
<p>As Kerry and Obama push forward, they must do so knowing that the domestic political landscape is sharply divided on foreign policy. The left base is unlikely to consider additional military action in the Middle East, and the right base is ready to get it on in the region under any conditions, including currently favoring military action in Syria and Iran. He can find some logical middle ground however, by reminding the American people that aggressive military action by us or Israel against Iran, will only temporarily stall Iran's quest for nuclear power. Allowing them this capability, which would be seen as being equivalent to our own nuclear power,  is perhaps the only thing that can create a sustaining pro-Western Iranian population.</p>
