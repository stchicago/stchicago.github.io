<p>President Bararck Obama addressed the nation this week in prime time, speaking directly to the American people about the situation in Syria. The situation in Syria, for those just tuning in, is as follows. In the past two years and change, the uprising in Syria has caused the deaths of over 110,000 Syrian people, with at least 40,000 civilians killed. Among this second group are thousands of innocent women and children. Additionally, over 20,000 rebel fighters have been killed, over 25,000 government soliders, and 15,000  mercenaries fighting for the Assad government. President Obama deserves a little skepticism because of his willingness to let events in the Middle East run the course they were running under Bush 43, but his urgency to get into Syria is understandable because as of August, people are being gassed like the Jews in Auschwitz, or the American Indians in the late 1690's by the British.</p>
<p>Bashar al-Assad, whose Syrian regime is being fought by the Rebels, and Vladimir Putin, Russia's prime-minister who is a friend of the regime, admits that chemical gases were used in Damascus, the capital of Syria. They are saying however, it was done by the rebel fighters, a group, which according to the Huffington Post, "relies on a network of activists, doctors and lawyers on the ground throughout Syria." Obama, with far more access to information on this matter then the general public, is convinced it was Assad's people who initiated the attack. So yes, even for the most ardent of anti-war believers, which includes us at this site, it is hard to sit idly by as innocent women and children are slaughtered due to a poisonous gas. It's the type of military move that shows no character, and above all, the world as one must stand for a unified front of respecting the innocent among us.</p>
<p>At the time Obama addressed the nation,  ABC news was indicating that 60% of the country is opposed to military intervention in the Syrian conflict. Accordingly, the president was in the position of having to defend his "redline" stance, and convince the nation that military intervention was in our best interests.</p>
<p>The president poignantly referenced the history of chemical weapons, which have been used against our soldiers, and those of our allies in both World Wars. He was right to do so. Many of us have forgotten that gassing used to be a regular war activity, going back as far World War I which was known as "the chemists' war," because of the deadly gases that were introduced to combat during the theater. At the Second Battle of Ypres, yellow-green chlorine gas was deployed by German troops. Yellow-Green chlorine is a choking agent that causes fluid to build up in the lungs of the victims.  National Geographic reports that several hundred French soldiers were killed in such a shocking manner that it has been suggested that the German soldiers themselves were so shocked by the chlorine gas' effects "that they failed to make an advance." (http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/08/130822. )</p>
<p>More recently, and closer to Syria, Iraq, in the eighties, used nerve gas against Kurdish Iraqis in the north, killing thousands of Kurds with deadly sarin and VX gas. These two gases in particular, are among the chemical weapons in Syria's suspected arsenal.</p>
<p>If you have chosen not to watch some of the video evidence that is out there, indicating that chemical weapons were used by Bashar Assad's government, you probably can look at this situation like a typical third party conflict that we, the United States, should refrain from joining. Ten year old stained memories from our poor decision to invade Iraq have likely made Americans more skeptical about Middle East military maneuvers. However, as Obama said in his prime time address, the gassings in Syria "can not be erased from memory." You should watch some of the videos. Keith Ellison, the very anti-war Democratic congressman from Minneapolis has said that if Obama would release half of the evidence which congress has been shown, then the American people would be more supportive of a strike.</p>
<p>Any action, we are being told, will be limited in scope, meaning neither "boots on the ground," nor a heavy U.S. military presence in Syria. But what we hear, is what we know.  There will be deaths, and there will be costs. The types of limited military operations that Obama could order in Syria, such as cruise missile strikes on military targets, may be more practical then sustained air force campaigns aimed at regime change. But no matter what happens, any action will effect America, including the likely impacts of higher fuel prices.</p>
<p>In making the case for a limited military response to Syria’s use of chemical weapons, Obama can not say that he is choosing between he best of bad options, which, unfortunately,  is exactly what he's doing. And Obama's firmness seems to be working, because it led to Assad doing the “I didn’t order chemical attacks” routine in his interview with Charlie Rose, and there's no way Assad does that interview if he didn’t think the United States was serious. Obama's threat was also strong enough to force Russia to offer a plan to put Syria’s weapons under international control, a move they almost certainly would have avoided had they not felt the attack on Syria was imminent.</p>
<p><b>                                                      The Russian Solution</b></p>
<p>We are going to have to wait and see if this thing is for real, but at least we haven't dropped a bomb yet, and that is because Secretary of State John Kerry gave a speech last week in which he described chemical attacks in Syria as "obscenit[ies]” which defy our national and international "moralities". Them definitely sound like fighting words. Kerry's speech on Syria was forceful and emotional, sounding like a seasoned general explaining the reasons for his orders. The Washington Post called it at a "a war speech."</p>
<p>Now war may be avoided because in an answer to the question of what the Syrian government could do to avert a U.S. attack, Kerry almost sarcastically said that Syria could avoid the strike by placing their chemical weapons under international control. "He isn't about to [do that],"Kerry said immediately following. U.S. officials, in the wake of Kerry's quip, said the comment was not intended to be a diplomatic opening, but it became one. Kerry’s Russian and Syrian colleagues acted as if it was a real olive branch, and while Kerry was on his way back to the United States to continue banging the war drum, the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lazarov issued the following statement.</p>
<p>“We are calling on the Syrian authorities [to] not only agree on putting chemical weapons storages under international control but also for its further destruction and then joining the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons,” Lavrov said. He continued, “[w]e have passed our offer to [Syrian Foreign Minister] Walid al-Moualem and hope to receive a fast and positive answer.” Moualem, already in Russia, said Syria “welcomes Russia’s initiative, based on the Syrian government’s care about the lives of our people and security of our country.” Boom, a possible path to peace through Moscow was born.</p>
<p>The Russian offer came quick, before Kerry's plane could have touched back down on U.S. soil. The quickness of such diplomatic action by an uneasy ally is likely based on the severity of possible U.S. strikes. Notice how in his op-ed piece in the New York Times, Putin deemed Obama trustworthy, and Obama is saying he's about to get in that Syrian ass to get them to stop using chemical weapons on innocent people.</p>
<p>Top brass progressive Democrats in Washington like Dianne Feinstein have already began floating the idea of Russia overseeing Syria's surrender of their chemical weapons as the right course of action. Internationally, news of Russia's intervention has been positively received by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, British Prime Minister David Cameron, French Foreign Minister Laurant Fabius, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.</p>
<p>Securing Syria’s toxic arsenal won’t be easy, and even if diplomats reach an agreement, eliminating Syria's chemical weapons stockpile could take years. It is going to be difficult to convince Russia to both: make the resolution militarily enforceable, as well as to enforce Syria's government to take the blame for the Aug. 21 chemical attack. Those responsible, according to international law, should be tried before an international criminal court. Obama knows this is no easy task, and that this Russian plan came together hastily based on his readiness to go hard. Anyone remember those Somali Pirates he had taken out with one shot? That's why he cautiously told Americans Russia holds "the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons" in Syria, but he also declared the U.S. military will "be ready to respond" against Assad if the measure fails.</p>
<p>We will find out very soon what happens. If this new diplomatic offering by Russia is only an excuse for Syria to buy more time and fool the international community, Obama will not wait long. The President is in no mood to give  credit for this rough situation back to Assad, a man who is waging a brutal war on his own people, having killed thousands, and displaced millions, or to the gay bashing Putin, unless he necessarily has to. They will get the credit however, if the offer is real, and Russia can get Syria to agree to a reasonable time line of turning over their chemical weapons. If that's done, it was likely Obama's willingness to threaten Syria, which led to a peaceful resolution. USA!</p>
<p>Of course, unfortunately, the whole thing could go majorly fucking wrong as well.</p>
