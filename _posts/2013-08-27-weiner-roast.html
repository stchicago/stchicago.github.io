<p>If insanity is truly doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results, then Anthony Weiner is insane. As a result of revelations this summer that he continued sexual online relations with women other then his wife following his resignation from congress, Weiner is now in last place in his bid to become New York City Mayor. His candidacy has become a sideshow as he's campaigning while still having to answer questions about his online activity. Weiner, aka Carlos Danger, can likely now be found in one of the five boroughs,  bellying up to podiums to defend and discuss his views on middle class America and job production. He's trying to talk in public about these things, but instead, the main thrust of his candidacy is again, his internet sex life, and the state of his marriage to Huma Abedin, a close advisor to Hilary Clinton. Now that people have seen the Good Wife,  Abedin looks a lot more like Julia Margolies, than she does her powerful former boss.</p>
<p>As Weiner continues his New York City mayoral bid, the first question that must be answered is why's the guy running? Besides looking for a public redemption, he claims having a child changed him for the better, and will make him a better mayor. That family who changed him for the better however, which coincided with his time away from politics, is now being thrust, by Weiner's own doing, back onto the world stage.</p>
<p>The second question is how did Weiner think he was going to get away with the same type of behavior that forced him to resign from congress. Instead of acting seriously towards amending his marriage, by perhaps joining a sex therapy program, or even lampooning himself in the media for the absurdity and stupidity of his own actions, Weiner decided that a year or so away from the public limelight was enough of a punishment.</p>
<p>Weiner, although he could have, and probably should have, joked about his online activities, did not. He neither laughed at himself nor at his behavior. Therefore, neither did we, until the light night hosts and political pundits started doing the joke telling for us.  Thus, the conclusion most of us have reached is that Anthony Weiner has psychiatric problems that cause him to act out online in sexually lewd ways. To the best of our knowledge, and his, that behavior is still a problem for him. He also has a very strong wife who will seemingly support him and his ambitions in the face of anything. While this is generally a strong asset, in this case, it almost makes her look Macbethian, as if this power couple has bigger plans then any one scandal can take down.</p>
<p>Weiner continues to say that "[w]hile some things that have been posted . . . are true and some are not, . . . what I did was wrong. This behavior is behind me. I've apologized to Huma and am grateful that she has worked through these issues with me and for her forgiveness. [W]e are focused on moving forward.” Time will tell if Weiner can truly move forward, in both in his marriage and his political career, but it was worth noting that sexual scandals and politicians are by no means strangers, but this one does seem to be in a league of its own. It appears this way because it's our first social networking scandal, and the evidence is available for the world to see.</p>
<p>What Weiner does have going for him is the fact that there have been no alleged actual sexual affairs in this scandal, as well as that all of Weiner's philandering was non-physical, consensual, and done in the privacy of of his own home. Thus, Wiener's scandal seems to be less sleazy then say your average John Edwards, or Bill Clinton drama, which is why the the guy probably sees a light at the end of the tunnel. In Clinton's case, he really did cheat on his wife, lied about it, and still, much to the delight of Anthony Weiner,  remains one of America's most popular politicians.</p>
<p>Republicans too, are no strangers to sex scandals. Mark Sanford finished his term as governor of South Carolina after admitting to a real sexual affair. Despite his wife leaving him, South Carolina voters forgave him by recently electing him to Congress earlier this year. Former Nevada senator, John Ensign,  was forced to resign a few years ago after it was revealed that had been having an affair with one of his aide's wife. He tried to cover it up by having his parents pay the couple nearly $100,000, and trying to get the aide a lobbying job in D.C.. And last but not least, Louisiana's David Vitter, was caught frequenting a prostitute, and still managed to keep his job running as an evangelical. So the road to redemption is bipartisan, but it's a hard road, and unfortunately for Weiner, the New York Media can be unrelenting.</p>
<p>The New York Times editorial board, as well as a plethora of Democratic party leaders, have been calling for Weiner to drop out of the mayoral race. Despite doing nothing against the law, Weiner is being asked to quit because he has become an embarrassment to New York City. Thus, a third question must be asked. Is this current mayoral scandal worse then Rudy's? Rudy Giulliani wasn't forced to step down when it was found out that in 1999, while mayor, he was cheating on his second wife, and he was using public money and the icy police force to carry on his affair. Public records indicate that there were city-financed trips to Southampton where his girlfriend had a condo, and city payments for undercover cops to escort his girlfriend around town.</p>
<p>According to realchange.org, the scandal was covered up by the Giuliani administration, and the expenses were hidden "by billing the money to obscure city agencies with no connection to security -- such as the Office of People With Disabilities, the Loft Board, and the Community Assistance Unit." Giulliani used some of the money from the obscure billing practices to pre-pay almost half a million dollars on to an American Express card which he then used to pay for hotels, meals, and gas on trips with his girlfriend. Additionally, realchange.com claims that Guiliani even made two police detectives walk his girlfriend's dog. Yes, New York's finest, scooping up poop from the mayor's mistress' pooch.</p>
<p>New York voters who will decide Weiner's fate, also have to grapple with the fact that even without the sex scandal, Weiner is at best a narcissistic, but ambitious  congressional deadweight. A July front-page New York Times story detailing Anthony Weiner’s time on the hill theorized that those who knew him best, said that Weiner "was a go-it-alone politician whose legislative record was thin and whose restlessness could spill into recklessness. He smartly selected issues on which to weigh in but left the difficult legislating to others."</p>
<p>Weiner's lack of congressional accomplishments are highlighted by the ineptitude of his time on the congressional immigration subcommittee. As Latino New Yorkers ask Weiner to elaborate on his achievements, or lack thereof, on behalf of immigration reform, he is left blaming only the Bush years, and the frenetic xenophobia that followed 9/11.  During the health care fight, the Times reported that Weiner "threatened behind the scenes to torpedo the [ Affordable Health Care Act] package," backing away only after being promised a bigger share of the debate spotlight. This all of course, may just be shrewd politics, but it also smells of smallness, similar indeed, to the stench left by Carlos Danger's online banter.</p>
<p>Reading some of the exchanges that Weiner had with the 23 year old woman from Chicago is like drinking year old milk and listening to it curdle in your stomach. This guy actually told her he wanted to leave his wife, and buy her a condo in Chicago. Up to this point, Weiner is so lucky just to have his wife's support. If she leaves, which she probably will, he is done. But, for all practical purposes, he's done already. After all, New Yorkers know that the only thing worse then not keeping your dick in your pants, is being a total dick.</p>
