<p>Hopefully, most people already knew that the following was true: gay people deserve to be treated with the same rights as straight people.  Thanks to the very recent majority ruling in the <i>United States vs. Windsor</i>  Supreme Court case, authored by Justice Kennedy, the law of the country now recognizes that the Defense of Marriage Act's (DOMA), "principal effect is to identify and make unequal a subset of state-sanctioned marriages. It contrives to deprive some couples married under the laws of their State, but not others, of both rights and responsibilities, creating two contradictory marriage regimes within the same State."</p>
<p>Kennedy gets props for writing this decision, and so do Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, Breyer, and Ginsburg for joining him. Thankfully, as with health care, one conservative justice decided to rule with the liberals, and this wacky court has a found their way to some common sense. Had the Court defined marriage as a heterosexual union, their decision would have violated the rights of married gay couples by denying them government benefits, straight up and down. DOMA, wrote Kennedy for the majority, “places same-sex couples in an unstable position of being in a second-tier marriage." “The differentiation," reasoned Kennedy, "demeans the couple, whose moral and sexual choices the Constitution protects, and whose relationship the state has sought to dignify.”</p>
<p>While there are certainly some people in this world who are still trying to figure out just exactly how gay marriage is assaulting their straight marriage, the rest of us likely welcomed the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Windsor</i>.  The finality that the Supreme Court’s decision brings to an issue which still confounds so many is very real, and will likely never be taken away.  Following the ruling, gay couples have the comfort of knowing that they will be treated equally like any married couple.</p>
<p>For married gay couples in states that recognize same-sex marriage, the decision means access to over a thousand federal benefits like filing joint income tax returns, receiving Social Security benefits, and military spousal benefits. The impact is more unclear in states like Missouri, where there exists a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, and Illinois, a state which recognizes civil unions but doesn’t allow for same sex marriage. So, for example, a same-sex couple that was married and living in a state like Massachusetts which recognizes same sex marriage, would be able to receive Social Security benefits. That same couple however, if they were married in Massachusetts, but lived in Missouri for work, could not receive the benefits. The Court's opinion made clear that they wanted an act of Congress for that type of federal change.</p>
<p>The opposition is likely shocked, as now hell has legally frozen over. Amongst the dissenting justices, was the notorious Antonin Scalia. This of course is unsurprising given that Scalia's theory of civil rights likely involves an imaginary  paradise of straight, WASPY people. His showcased such ideas a day after the <i>Windsor</i> verdict when he was part of the majority that voted to overturn the most significant portion of the Voting Rights Act. Justices like Scalia and Roberts do not believe that racial minorities, or gays, continue to face barriers to voting or getting married in states with a history of discrimination. Accordingly, Scalia's dissent was the real "argle bargle" as he used it to throw salt at the gay rights movement, and berate the court for even weighing in on the issue.</p>
<p>Scalia, who clearly should have been asked to play Gargamel in the Smurf movies, accused the majority of having "declar[ed] anyone opposed to same-sex marriage an enemy of human decency." "We have no power to decide this case, . . . even if we did, we have no power under the Constitution to invalidate this democratically adopted legislation. The Court’s errors on both points spring forth from the same diseased root: an exalted conception of the role of this institution in America.” His use of the term "diseased root" is pernicious, but then again, so is he.</p>
<p>Scalia further writes that the court is committing judicial supremacy by setting rules of the road that won't allow legislators to discriminate against consenting adults who choose to exercise their right of liberty, by selecting their own partners, equally under they eyes of the law, regardless of how they get it on. Judicial supremacy from the highest court in the land, clearly Scalia shouldn't be shocked.</p>
<p>As celebrations ensue across the country, it is worth remembering good ol' Joe Biden, who kicked the gay marriage debate into high gear with the comment that he was "comfortable" with gay marriage, while Obama was still officially "evolving" on the issue. "I am vice president of the United States of America," Biden told NBC's Meet The Press. "The President sets the policy," Biden said, "[but] I am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women, and heterosexual men and women marrying another are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties. And quite frankly, I don't see much of a distinction -- beyond that." Obama then followed suit, then Hilary, and before long, there was real momentum.</p>
<p>The decision will produce positive, quick results, and already has. On the morning the verdict was announced, a New York City Immigration judge stopped deportation proceedings against a Colombian man married to a gay American citizen after he found out about the Court's ruling on DOMA. According to the DOMA project's Facebook page, the ruling which their intern had run over to the court and delivered to the judge  "was still warm from the printer."</p>
<p>As a result of the Court's findings in <i>Windsor</i>, the inherent inequality between gay and straight marriages within the same state for purposes such as taxes and benefits, is now equal under the eyes of the law. DOMA was discriminating against state-sanctioned marriages by creating two contradictory marriage regimes within the same State, and now gay Americans have found that the highest court in the land cares for their "dignity" as Kennedy put it, and will not allow a class of citizens to harmed in states where legislators and citizens have intentionally set out to protect them.</p>
<p>According to the Associated Press, just two weeks after the Court's <i>Windsor</i> decision, the American Civil Liberties Union, (ACLU) is bringing the decision to  bare on the state level in Pennsylvania against that state's same-sex marriage ban. Part of the ACLU's efforts are also aimed at preventing state officials there from creating legislative road blocks that will further challenge same-sex couples seeking a legal marriage. The Washington Post reports that 23 plaintiffs will be part of this lawsuit, including gay couples, children of gay couples, and the widow of a same-sex couple that was together for 29 years, similar to the defendant in <i>Windsor, </i>who was with her partner for over thirty years.</p>
<p>We at Saint Chicago applaud the bench for valuing relationships, and mandating that any American relationship be respected like everybody else's.</p>
