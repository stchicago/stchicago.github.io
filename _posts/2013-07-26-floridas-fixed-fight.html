<p>As George Zimmerman becomes a right wing hero, and Trayvon Martin's parents attempt to put their lives back together, it is clear that Florida, and other states with similar laws, must repeal their "Stand Your Ground" self-defense legislation. The law perpetuates both unnecessary violence, and unnecessary violence directed at non-whites. Tragedies like the fatal shooting of Martin, an unarmed black teenager by a white guy playing cop, are currently justified under the law. As President Obama pointed out when he compared himself to a young Trayvon Martin, had Martin had a gun, would he have been legally able to shoot Zimmerman who was following Martin in his car? Not sure how you could not say that Martin would have been justified under the law if he had had a gun to shoot the guy who was creeping up on him.</p>
<p>According to the Rachel Maddow Show, the "Stand Your Ground" law has been recognized in Florida courts to support shooting someone who is already on the ground, and shooting someone in the back of the head. The law encourages certain people who are either hatred, or violence prone, to shoot their way out of situations and into situations. It blurs the legal line that is the barometer of our civilization. Provoking someone into a fight can lead to your ability to shoot them because you claim you were scared to death and standing your ground. This type of shoot-first theorizing not only sounds good to the NRA, but it brings up the scary reality that a mentality of civil militias is starting to permeate states like Florida.</p>
<p>According to the jury instructions in the Zimmerman trial, Zimmerman had "no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force" if he reasonably feared for his life or suffering imminent, great bodily harm. Without the law, Zimmerman would have had a duty to retreat to safe ground if he were able to ever gain the high ground. It would seem to me that once a gun is drawn upon someone, the upper hand is gained, saved for a few Jackie Chan movies.</p>
<p>"Stand Your Ground" was not specifically cited as part of Zimmerman's defense, but there is little doubt that the jury instructions helped pave the way for his acquittal. The truth will always be that Trayvon Martin was killed for wearing a hooded sweatshirt, eating skittles, and being black. More accurately, he was black in the wrong place and time, which apparently is still a grave crime in this country, and in this century. The underlying message by the police and defense in the case said that a white man like Zimmerman has the right to self-defense but a young black male like Martin, does not. The verdict leaves us with the uncomfortable truth that in this country, a white person is still justified in fearing a black person to death if they have to go at each other in a fist to fist fight. Will this theory work when the racial roles were reversed. At least in Florida, the fact that the young black Martin could have been, and likely was in fear for his life, seems to be completely lost on people.</p>

<p><strong>What Should Have Happened</strong></p>
<p>Following the recusal of the Seminole County district attorney and multiple judges, the state's lawyers should have made motion for a change of venue where the judge would have faced less local political pressures, and therefore be unsusceptible to election issues following a guilty Zimmerman verdict. This is no easy task, as a change of venue takes place only when the judge sees such overwhelming support against the defendant that it would prejudice the case. Whether that happened here is debatable, although I'm sure the lawyers could have made pretty strong prejudicial grounds by showing how the local police had already let the defendant go for 24 hours. Additionally, one of the jurors felt so close to the defendant that the juror told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she referred to the defendant by his first name, "George."</p>
<p>Due to the Stand Your Ground laws, and the fact that the other party privy to the happenstance had been killed, this case was not an easy case. Prosecutors appeared disinterested however, allowing the "yes" answer, of the Sanford police officer who was asked if he believed Zimmerman's story of self-defense, to ride for 24 hours without the prosecution objecting. Witnesses should not be permitted to offer an opinion on the credibility of a story coming from another witnesses. The next day when prosecutors asked the judge to strike that portion, she did, but the jury had heard and seen what it needed.</p>
<p><b>Why Black People Are So Upset</b></p>
<p>Contemporary racism is a well documented issue: the list of hits includes: segregated housing lending; racial profiling,; legally attacking affirmative action gains, and supplemental nutrition programs; excessive police brutality against minorities; and the overwhelming history of slavery and segregation.  As President Obama acknowledged, this trial and verdict strikes a resonating chord within us all, especially for black men, or those of us who hang out with black men at night. We see this story through a different set of experiences.</p>
<p>See the thing is, following the conclusion of the Civil War, and the beginning of modern American racism as we know it, white people decided the best way to deal with the stain of slavery was to sweep it under the rug, or put it behind the big old grandfather clock in the hallway. Evidence of such practice surfaced recently when Purdue University President Mitch Daniel's had to deal with surfaced emails which showed Daniels, when he was governor of Indiana, wanted to prevent Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States" from being used in K-12 classrooms. The emails mention that he wants to "disqualify" the text, and that he refers to the book as "propaganda." For those who don't know, it's the book from the bar scene in <i>Good Will Hunting</i> when Matty Damon schools the Harvard guy.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on the impact slavery had on black people who had no control over their situation, white America has perfected the practice of surrounding itself with the idea that a contemporary positive outlook on life and race is better then adequately confronting the problem head on. For example, in Germany, there are Holocaust laws that teach Germans about their awful involvement under Hitler, so very few people believe that Jews in Europe need to get over the Holocaust. White American people have had no significant mistreatment of their own, nothing to overcome except problems they created, so it is harder for them to develop empathy. Poor jobs numbers also don't help old wounds.</p>
<p>Thus, we here at Saint Chicago can not be shocked by the Martin verdict. A jury with only one black male American said that the killing of a black male teenager was justified because  our country still perpetuates the narrative that a young, agile, weed smoking black man is out to do terrible things, and should instill the fear of god into any white person who is presumably doing wonderful things, like assaulting a black kid for walking home and eating skittles.</p>
<p>In fairness to those who believe that race had nothing to do with this case, it is true that the way the Stand Your Ground Law is phramed, all the person has to do is say they were in fear of their life, and the shooting becomes justified. So, while there may have been no racism at all in this case, it does come down to the fact that an unarmed black teenager is enough of a threat to someone to with a gun that it justifies killing the black teenager if a scuffle occurs.</p>
<p>So, Americans will keep on  claiming that that they aren't racists,  yet still believe that Obama is a Kenyan, and black teenagers are all thugs. Our country is sadly still as Richard Wright described her in his novel <i>Black Boy</i>- “Our too-young and too-new America, lusty because it is lonely, aggressive because it is afraid, insists upon seeing the world in terms of good and bad, the holy and the evil, the high and the low, the white and the black; our America is frightened of fact, of history, of processes, of necessity. It hugs the easy way of damning those whom it cannot understand, of excluding those who look different, and it salves its conscience with a self-draped cloak of righteousness.”</p>
<p>So Trayvon Martin punched this neighborhood watchmen in the face, does mean the watchmen can shoot him dead?</p>
