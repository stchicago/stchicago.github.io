<p>When Justice John Roberts authored the 5-4 2012 Supreme Court decision upholding the Affordable Care Act, ( Obamacare ) many conservatives felt betrayed and upset. However, as of this month, Republican governors Terry Branstad of Iowa, and Jan Brewer of Arizona will be the eighth and ninth Republican governors to sign their states on to Obamacare. Brandstad and Brewer, who are deeply conservative, join other conservative governors from Florida, Michigan, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, and Nevada who have come out in favor of expanding Medicaid coverage for their states. The fact that Republican governors are supporting Obamacare shouldn't be seen as shocking. Economists like Paul Krugman believe that "important new evidence — especially from California, the law’s most important test case — suggests that Obamacare will be a success."</p>
<p>Furthermore, Obamacare is a deeply conservative reform because it does very little to change the current state of health care, leaving most people’s health coverage unaffected. Thus, the vast majority of covered Americans who receive their health insurance from their employers, Medicare or Medicaid, will see very little change when the law goes into effect.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/opinion/krugman-the-obamacare-shock.html?hp&amp;_r=1&amp;"><b><br />

<p>Perhaps the eight remaining Republican governors who are refusing to increase the eligibility levels for their states should remember that it was a Republicans who started this whole Obamacare idea thing in the first place. Back in 2006, Governor Mitt Romney started a statewide health care program in Massachusetts, and in 2010, Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California legally established the first online insurance marketplace, or "exchange.” Arnold's exchanges are the key ingredient of President Obama’s health-care reform. Upon implementing the law’s Medicaid expansion, California has seen it's uninsured population decline from 20 percent to less than five.<b> </b></p>
<p>Some of this republican love for Obamacare is likely due to positive feedback from constituents, on both sides of the isle, that says Obamacare is working. Kenneth P. Thomas, a Political Science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said that almost 13 million Americans have received rebates from insurance companies due to the fact that their premiums were higher then the amount of actual health care they received.<b> </b>Additionally, no American man, woman, or child can be denied access to health insurance based on a pre-existing conditions.</p>
<p>Just like Brandstad, New Jersey Gov., and once Republican Mega-star Chris Christie, also welcomed Obamacare into New Jersey society. Expanding Medicaid, explained Christie, represented fiscal prudence. The $300 million or so his state stood to receive from Obamacare's measures for increased federal funding to the states who add more low-income residents to their Medicaid rolls was an offer Christie couldn't refuse.<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/02/26/1642121/chris-christie-medicaid/)"><b><br />
</b></a></p>
<p>In the move to announce his alignment with Obamacare, Christie said that his decision was based on his desire to put "people first.” In his budget address to the city, which included the Obamacare association, he said New Jersey had "an opportunity to ensure that an even greater number of New Jerseyans at or near the poverty line will have access to critical health services beginning in January 2014.” Big Chris was also likely paying attention to what has been happening in California and Massachussets, the two states who have adopted Obamacare the longest.</p>
<p>In the past few years, the health insurance companies of California and Massachussetts, who base their pricing options on the states' exchanges, submitted pricing requests that were much lower then previously estimated. Accordingly, the free market is doing its job. Quality goes up or stays the same, prices go down, everybody wins. Republicans in general, as the defenders of the free market, need to be more friendly about this fact.</p>
<p>If Republican governors continue to act as road blocks to affordable health care in their states, they will likely be seen not just as obstructionists, but as  responsible for hurting the people who are too poor to afford health coverage. Such poor Americans could be covered by a federally financed expansion of Medicaid, but in the eight states where Republicans have blocked Medicaid expansion, many uncovered Americans will be out of luck.</p>
