        <p>Saint Chicago is a weekly news blog where we will feature stories and profiles from politics, pop culture, and beyond. We hope to be a small part of your dinner conversations during the week, as well as a place to turn when you want some spin free information about trending topics. The editorial staff is based in Saint Louis and Chicago, and while we plan on covering topics from these respective cities, we will shape the dialogue to be attributable to the national conversation. We've taken the time to research and provide positions for both sides of every argument, and will adhere to strict standards of objectivity with a bi-partisan, reasonable stance on current events.</p>
