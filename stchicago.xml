				<title>Walmart Assault Weapons for Sale</title>

		<description></description>
		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<p dir="ltr">Today's post looks into the proposed Assault Weapons ban, and other congressional legislation geared to curb excessive gun violence. Let us start off by saying that while guns are great and no one is saying we should take them away, let us also agree that most Americans do favor some sort of controlling measures to try and prevent more mass shootings like those most recently in Arizona, Colorado, and Connecticut.<!--more--> According to polling in mid-February from Pew/USA Today, over 80 percent of Americans support  background checks on gun sales. The same poll also showed that over fifty percent of Americans favored the bans on assault style weapons and high-capacity clips as well.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, it is clear that politics, for whatever reason, is also clouding the debate. According to a January, 2013 Washington Post-ABC poll, Democrats support Obama’s gun control proposals 76 percent of the time, while 72 percent of Republicans do not. Independents who were polled voted 51% in favor of gun control. However, in the same poll, but prior to Obama putting his stamp on the newest proposed restrictions, 85% of Republicans supported requiring background checks at gun shows, 59 percent supported a ban on high-capacity clips. What that says is that there are still almost a quarter of the Republican party who don't hate Obama so much that they won't listen to an argument for one of his policy positions. The rest of the Republicans are letting a seemingly contrived grievance with the president get in their way of governing. After all, as the party who is supposed to be focused almost solely on keeping taxes down and the stock market high, they are awfully good at being awfully mad at President Obama for keeping the U.S. stock market at record high volumes, and taxes near historical lows.</p>
<p dir="ltr">Gun control advocates repeatedly lean on the Second Amendment of the Constitution which states that "a well-regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state, the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed." The argument thus goes that the founding fathers wanted everyone to have a gun, just like Pras of the Fugees. However, gun control itself is not a modern contrivance, but goes back to the founding of the country. The Second Amendment is not, and likely was not meant to be, a libertarian license for everyone to have any gun at anytime they pleased. This assertion is supported by the fact that the founding fathers restricted large segments of the population from owning guns in ways that would make them out of touch with today’s NRA crowd. The obvious example that comes to mind is that slaves and free blacks were barred from having guns, and at times even law-abiding white men, like those unwilling to swear an oath of loyalty to the revolution. So, rather then having a history of gun liberalism, America's forefathers were actually quite conservative on the issue.</p>
We turn now to the belief that the Second Amendment forbids the government to "infringe" upon any civilian's rights to "keep and bear arms." This belief is unfounded however. For, just as the First Amendment does not give us the right scream "fire" in a crowded theatre when there is no actual fire, the Second does not prevent the government from reasonably enacting regulations which would control how guns are made, dealt, and owned and possessed.
<p dir="ltr">Justice Scalia, who wrote the majority opinion in District of Columbia v. Heller, a case which endorsed the idea that all Americans have the right to bear modern handheld weapons not invented at the time of the founding of the country. However, in a July, 2012 interview with Fox's Chris Wallace, Scalia, in response to a question about limitations, said "obviously, the amendment does not apply to arms that cannot be hand-carried. It’s to keep and bear. So, it doesn’t apply to cannons. But I suppose there are handheld rocket launchers that can bring down airplanes that will have to be–it will have to be decided." As Justice Scalia, and all of us now undoubtedly know, there are hand held weapons that allow a person to walk into a school and fire off 152 rounds in less then fifteen minutes by using magazines that can hold 30 bullets at a time. We shouldn't have to wait for another set of suits against the federal government.</p>
<p dir="ltr">In conclusion, we,  as do most sensible hunters, gun owners, and sport shooters know there is no way in hell all guns will ever have to be given up. But making a case to get rid of Bushmasters or the AR-15, the weapon used in the Batman, Aurora shooting, an eerily similar piece of equipment to the military’s M-16, is much easier and sensible to do. According to Pulitzer Prize winner and hunter Jon Meachem, these guns have "no sporting purpose save playacting, in which the shooter is in some kind of combat situation." We agree. To anyone whose idea of a good time is reenacting the Ice-T classic <em>Surviving the Game</em> with real ammunition and similar weaponry, we think you should take up tackle football or hockey. Either that, or take your impressive lobbying skills and finances, buy some territory in Canada or Mexico, and go live out your fantasy there. Finally, remember that even if you are only allowed to have a ten capacity magazine clip, you still got one in the chamber.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Saint Chicago is a weekly news blog where we will feature stories and profiles from politics, pop culture, and beyond. We hope to be a small part of your dinner conversations during the week, as well as a place to turn when you want some spin free information about trending topics. The editorial staff is based in Saint Louis and Chicago, and while we plan on covering topics from these respective cities, we will shape the dialogue to be attributable to the national conversation. We've taken the time to research and provide positions for both sides of every argument, and will adhere to strict standards of objectivity with a bi-partisan, reasonable stance on current events.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://stchicago.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DSC_0112.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-24" alt="DSC_0112" src="http://stchicago.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/DSC_0112-300x300.jpg" width="300" height="300" /></a>Homeowners across the country in diverse and educated communities are battling the uncomfortable reality that their property taxes are going up while the value of their houses are going down. What's going on?<!--more-->

In cities such as Chicago, Saint Louis, New York City, and Philadelphia, large universities are partly responsible for taxpayers facing increasing property taxes despite plummeting home values. The responsibility lies in the fact that some universities, by purchasing additional properties in their area,  are taking large portions of taxable property off the municipal books. Nonprofits like the University of Pennsylvania (Penn) , or the University of Chicago do provide good jobs and useful services to their communities, but they also act as a burden on their respective cities. Their students and staff who live and work on campus, or in campus owned buildings, use public services like roads, and fire and safety without any of their tuition dollars going to pay for them. Many students who live off campus, are now choosing to live in school owned homes and buildings, meaning their landlord is not paying taxes either.

Schools are Going for the Land Grab

Penn owns so much land in Philly that the tension between locals and the school are high. Bumper stickers have been spotted around the city protesting Penn's propensity to describe every neighborhood they buy property in as "University City". The stickers read "This is West Philly, University City is a marketing scheme." Gentrification in Philadelphia is referred to as "Penntrification."

In University City, Missouri, where Washington University (Wash U.) is situated, the burden is weighing on both old and young taxpayers. New buyers are scared over rising taxes on properties that are worth less then half of what they were when John Kerry ran for President, and many older owners who are on a fixed retirement income, will no longer be able to afford to stay in their homes. Relief will be hard to come by because lawmakers and voters are hesitant to raise a lot of noise over the issue as the universities do create stable local jobs, especially high paying white collar positions.

Following Penn's lead, the University of Chicago has been buying up swaths of land in the Hyde Park neighborhood of Chicago, Wash U. has been going nuts buying real estate in Saint Louis. It looks a little something like this: Wash U. puts forth a steady flow of capital into formerly downtrodden neighborhoods around the Delmar Loop; University City sees high values in rental and retail rates, jobs being created, and amenities being offered to their residents; and eventually the ugly topic of the effect the university improvements have on demographics with respect to race and class is raised. The subsequent discussion demands an answer as to whether private schools of higher learning are really civic benefactors who improve their neighborhoods, or are large private institutions accidentally acting as race and class manipulators.

PILOTS are not Enough to Fly the Plane

Some universities do make PILOT ( payments in lieu of taxes) contributions to their cities . Baltimore gets $5.4 million a year from PILOTs, and Boston is at $17.4 million. St. Louis, Chicago and Philadelphia do not seem to be bothered by the fairness notion, however.  Philly nonprofits contributed a measly $496,810.40 in 2011 PILOT payments, while St. Louis and Chicago institutions contributed nada. To make matters worse, Philly lawmakers know they are hurting the city because in the 1980s and ’90s, Philadelphia established a program through which larger nonprofit organizations like universities and the hospitals did pay a third of the property taxes due from a taxpaying organizations of similar size. Philadelphia collected $8.8 million in 1996 alone. While the Philly program is no longer in effect, it does provide other cities who suffer from lack of tax collection with a blueprint for managing a way to get their hands on millions of dollars each year.

Administrators will point to the fact that higher taxes on a university will lead to higher tuition rates. Accordingly, parents who are dolling out their savings, or students who are busting their butts serving dishes and dancing on poles to come up with tuition money, will not think of their respective universities as being a bargain. Despite all the noble educating going on in the hallowed halls, the modern university hardly seems like a storefront charity. Yet in the eyes of the IRS, they are. As such, they are exempt from paying property tax on their real estate. This authority comes from section 501-c-3 of the IRS tax code which provides that buildings used for education and health are tax exempt.

In Conclusion

PILOT programs can really help when they are exercised adequately, as in Boston, or Baltimore, but they are not the answer if stronger regulation does not accompany their operations. A 2010 study done by the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy found that PILOTs, as currently structured and administered, do not deliver similar amounts of revenue to that which is lost to the nonprofits’ tax exemptions. Therefore, the revenue must be made up, and should not be shifted to local taxpayers, most of whom do not work for the schools. The mayor of Pittsburgh, Luke Ravenstahl once proposed something he called the "tuition tax." The tax was to have been a 1 percent tax on Pittsburgh based college tuition to help support city services. The plan would have added $16.2 million annually to his city. While Ravenstahl's initiative ultimately failed, we think the issue deserves more suggestions and proposals for ensuring that tax-exempt entities pay a reasonable portion of the metropolitan service costs will be highly valued by municipal governments.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Republicans May Have Found Their Own Gay Marriage </title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As the University of Kentucky and Louisiville Basketball programs can attest to, the state of Kentucky can produce some fine basketball players. The state also produces some great smokeable grass. Republican Senator Rand Paul thinks it might be time for us to be able to legally smoke it.<!--more--> Kentucky, as recently as 2009, was the nation’s fourth largest illegal producer of homegrown marijuana. The weed produced there however, is not the great problem, according to Rand Paul, it's the illegal trade of legal prescription drugs. The DEA has handed out as many as 181 months to  Kentuckians who were caught traveling from Ohio to Florida with obtained and filled prescriptions for oxycodone and other drugs.  Guilty of doing it just like Walgreen's, only wrapped really well in yesterday's newspaper and shipped inside a stuffed Disney toy.

2016 potential Republican presidential candidate Paul seemingly threw his hat in the ring for office by suggesting he would support legalizing marijuana. He reminded us that had George W., or Barack Obama been caught smoking marijuana as they did in their past, they "could have been put in jail for their drug use." Look what would have happened," said Paul, "it would have ruined their lives." We at Saint Chicago, in a nod to broad thinking on both sides of the aisle, agree with Paul. And, as a republican who supports states deciding the issue of marijuana legalization for themselves, we salute him for somewhat boldly proposing policy which will weaken the stranglehold that US drug policy has on decisions made by the states, especially in the current political context.

<b>Marijuana is a Civil Right.</b>

Supporters of gay marriage have long argued that having a good time, how you please, is a matter of liberty. Demonstrating the remarkable way the once  contentious issue of legal pot can be framed, Virginia Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli recently told college students at the University of Virginia that he was "evolving" on marijuana legalization, just like President Obama has said his views on gay marriage had been evolving prior to his announcement that he supports equal marriage rights.  When asked about voters legalizing weed in Colorado and Washington last election cycle, Cuccinelli said he wasn't sure about Virginia’s future, but said he was watching Colorado and Washington closely.

Just like gay marriage, legal weed, over the past decade has picked up broader, bipartisan support for change. As the American arc towards progress is gradual, but persistent, we are not surprised that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is now supporting the legalization of hemp. He is joined by Oregon Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley, as well as Paul. The bill they have cosponsored would allow Americans to grow hemp. While hemp is not the same as regular marijuana, namely it has much less THC, itis currently classified in the same category as heroin.

Opposition to médical marijuana, and legal marijuana as well, is also staring to look extreme and hypocritical. The 5th Amendment "The right of the people to be secure in their  persons, houses, papers, and effects, against unreasonable searches and seizures, shall not be violated." For over and fifty years, this right was extended to weed smokers in the United States who had been encouraged to use the substance. Then, in in 1937, the Marihuana Tax Act was passed which prohibited the legal distribution of marijuana for non-medical purposes.

<b>The Background is Always Interesting</b>

<b> </b>A brief recanting would read that in 1930, then Treasury Secretary Andrew W. Mellon appointed his nephew by marriage Harry J. Anslinger, to direct the brand new Federal Bureau of Narcotics. At the time, Mellon made most of his money from Mellon Bank, and they were making boatloads of money off of their investments in the DuPont chemical company. The decade coming out of prohibition saw companies like DuPont and Monsanto radically transform themselves in the rapid embrace of plastics and synthetic fibbers.

Prior to this, hemp and other natural products were used and sourced for a great deal of applications which DuPont wished to replace with synthetic plastics. Plastic, is made from mineral, chemical, petroleum, and fossil fuel deposits. Companies have excelled at finding ways to use these harsh deposits to make all kinds of goods which used to be made from natural products like hemp.

Mellon and Dupont steered Anslinger to the papermill and newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst. Eliminating hemp would harm him none, and enrich him more. Spreading disinformation about hemp, he started referring to it in his vast publications as the Spanish sounding marijuana, a blatant attempt to increase his anti-Mexican sentiments. So, as Rand Paul supporters would probably agree, this is no no noble place to start.

<b>Legal Weed is Mainstream Republican Idealogy</b>

Rand Paul is not breaking new ground. His dad has been pushing a full legalization on all drugs for years. Newsweek wrote that way back in the 2010 election cycle, it wasn't Nancy Pelosi favoring legalized pot, but John Dennis, her Republican challenger. At one point on the campaign, Dennis had staffers alter his sign to have Rastafarian color scheme and a pot leaf. For real. Conservatives, like Grover Norquist, can also point to the fact that legalization touches on issues of national security and fiscal prudence. In other words, growing it in your basement is better then having it shipped from Mexico, and the slightest of hints that the mainstream position of America is that we are currently losing two wars, Afganistan, and the war on drugs.

Moving forward, it will be likely that more Republican lawmakers will either have a change of heart themselves, or follow the Rob Portman move of empathizing with their pot-smoking son or daughter in the support of legal pot.  Republicans can talk about the need to prioritize law-enforcement efforts and budgets in the recessionary economy, and the small government crowd gets to argue that if somebody is smoking or growing pot in their own house, then feds and local authorities should be busy worrying about other ways to  protect and serve.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Jackie Robinson Movie Should Have Played Hardball</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a class="fresco" href="http://stchicago.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/jackie-robinson-and-joe-louis-1946-sized.jpg"><img class="alignnone size-thumbnail wp-image-22" alt="BE053718" src="http://stchicago.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/jackie-robinson-and-joe-louis-1946-sized-150x150.jpg" width="150" height="150" /></a>"42," the new film telling of Jackie Robinson’s first year with the Brooklyn Dodgers in 1947 may be an entertaining effort, but it's immediately flawed by the PG-13 rating. The rating will force the film to cover up the bruises and cuts of racism that stung Robinson and other black ball players. The PG-13 rating foretells an uninspired and inaccurate narration of what Jackie went through. The great hero that Jackie became following his integrating baseball was not whom he was recognized as in his first year. His first game was met with no fanfare other than racist hecklers. Despite scoring the winning run in the seventh inning, Robinson's feat didn't make the front-pages of the The New York Times. Only later was his breaking the color line seen as the catalyst for the Civil Rights. Following Robinson's first year, President Truman proceeded with integration of the military, and seven years later, the U.S. Supreme Court outlawed school segregation. Martin Luther King Jr. called Robinson an original freedom rider for the endurance of his difficult struggle to find acceptance among whites.

A movie about Jackie Robinson's life has to be rated R, or NC-17. Before getting to his historic first year in the big leagues, let's start with his childhood in Cairo, Georgia. His father was a sharecropper, and like many other sharecroppers, was forced into a life of almost certain poverty. At a young age his father left the family, and he lived amongst racial discrimination of the Jim Crow South on the Jim Sasser plantation. Jackie's mother was rescued by her family in Pasadena, California, and she was able to move the family West.

<b>Just Getting There was Tough Enough</b>

Robinson's mother, Malllie, raised the family in Pasadena, Calif., where she washed and ironed for meager wages. Jackie watched his mother sweat to the bone, and dealt with typical race relations of the day like having to watch crosses burning on his front lawn. Watching the stoicism his mom displayed in dealing with such incidents of racism left a strong impression on Jackie however. She taught him how to brush racism off his shoulders, and in doing so, even endeared herself to some of their white neighbors. In doing so, she opened up the doorways for her son to display his color-blind athleticism amongst the other white kids in playground sports. Jackie even joined a gang, called the Pepper Street Gang, and challenged other gangs in football for money. Toughened up by bouts with the police, and these intense sporting conflicts for money, Jackie became a stud athlete. Perhaps most significantly of all, Jackie watched his older brother finish as the silver medalist in '36 to Jesse Owens, only to be treated as a nobody once he returned. An African-American, Jackie learned, can't even catch a break by winning the Silver medal in the Olympics.

Life before he started playing sports was hard on Jackie, but the kids he went up against in competition always made sure he never had it easy. Robinson had to go through football games and practices where his own teammates, and the opposition, got to take a lick on him every time he touched the ball. He was the running back, so he pretty much caught full-on assaults for eight straight years. You think the Bears and Packers hate each other, you should see how the integration of football played out around the country.

In his final high school game, after the whistle had blown the first play dead, a player from rival Muir, threw Jackie to the groun, breaking both Robinson's ribs. Robinson's major college hopes were dashed, and only through the hard work of his family, was he able to play at Pasadena Junior College where he earned his way back to elite football level to get attention from UCLA. Indeed, while playing football at Pasadena in 1937, Jackie decided to play baseball for the college, and as such, got to play against the mighty Chicago White Sox who took their spring training in Pasadena. White Sox manager Jimmy Dykes said at the time that if Robinson were white, the Sox would sign him.

Five years later, in 1942, Robinson was drafted into the Army. He was shipped to Fort Riley, Kansas. There, he applied to the Officers' Candidate School, and he, like other black candidates, were not allowed into the program.  However, with the help of world heavyweight champion boxer Joe Louis, who was also stationed at Fort Riley, Robinson was able to successfully petition for the right to attend the school. Robinson was eventually commissioned a second lieutenant in 1943. Robinson's feats began to represent the will and strong backbone of blacks whom were beginning to make stronger pushes for racial justice in America.

<b>Breaking the Major League Color Line</b>

<b> </b>Following World War II, Robinson was signed by the Kansas City Monarchs of the Negro Leagues. Robinson played well with Monarchs, finishing first in batting average. He got a spot in the Negro League's all-star game where he was closely watched by baseball scouts sent by Branch Rickey. Rickey, the president of the Brooklyn Dodgers, was evangelically determined to break Major League's color line. He had spent some time searching for the ideal candidate, and soon saw Robinson as his guy. He especially liked that Robinson was talented, smart and did not drink. Furthermore, thanks to his time in Pasadena and college, had played alongside whites before. According to Rickey's grandson, when a journalist asked Rickey if he thought “all hell would break loose” when Robinson took the field for the first time, Rickey answered, "I believe tomorrow all heaven will rejoice."

Robinson didn't need Rickey to tell him there would be difficult times, and he was tested in difficult ways right from the beginning. There is no way you could consider the things people in the crowds would yell at him as PG-13. To do history justice, this movie needs an R rating to accurately portray the type of society Robinson was living in. The words and jeers Robinson received  alone deserve the R rating, but he was also assaulted, with things being thrown at him, as well as he and his family receiving death threats.  All this was in first year, and even some of his teammates objected to his being on the team.

That Jackie Robinson succeeded in getting past the prejudice and racial strife is a story worth telling. But that prejudice and racial strife should not be cleaned up into a cookie cutter retelling that makes the post-WW II American racial divide seem like anything other than a hellacious time for American blacks. The things Jackie Robinson went through are as scary as any horror movie, and as shocking as any adult thriller. Accordingly, the retelling of his life needs to be rated R.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[In the horrible aftermath of the Boston Marathon bombing, and the 24 hour fugitive escape four days later, Republican senators, led by Lindsey Graham, S.C., John McCain, Ariz., and Kelly Ayotte, N.H., tried to check some of the Constiution's power by suggesting that Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, the 19-year-old suspect, a U.S. citizen, was not a "common criminal."<!--more--> Instead they suggested he was a "candidate for enemy combatant status." A press release detailing the reasoning the three senators gave for not allowing our strong criminal justice system to handle this already weakened criminal stated that "[i]t is clear the events we have seen over the past few days in Boston were an attempt to kill American citizens and terrorize a major American city."  The statement continued, "the accused perpetrators of these acts were not common criminals attempting to profit from a criminal enterprise, but terrorists trying to injure, maim and kill innocent Americans."

The senators are right about Dzhokhar Tsarnaev having committed acts of terror, but an American terrorizing other Americans is not terrorism under military jurisdiction, it is called — <em>committing a crime</em>. After all, couldn't any parent of the Newtown tragedy, or Columbine term the American citizen killers of their children as "not common criminals attempting to profit from a criminal enterprise, but terrorists trying to injure, maim and kill innocent Americans?"

If Tsarnaev were given enemy combatant status instead of his fair day in court, he could be tried in a military tribunal and the proceedings would be controlled to a greater degree. Think Guantanamo. This status would allow the FBI to invoke a public safety exemption to standard criminal procedures and go unconstitutional on his ass. The forgoing of these constitutional rights would be justified by the public's interest and need to know about any remaining active bombs or plots. For example, the authorities could question Tsarnaev without telling him that he had the right not to incriminate himself. They wouldn't have to tell him he had the right to an attorney for example, or the right to remain silent.

As it became apparent that the two brothers had acted alone, the feds were directed to read the surviving suspect his rights. They then charged him with heinous crimes in the presence of his court appointed lawyer. If Tsarnaev is convicted in federal court, which he will certainly be, he will be sentenced to death or spend the rest of life in prison. Is there any worse punishment that is constitutional? Those constitutional limits, as meager as they be sometimes, are the difference between acting right and wrong.

<strong>An Easy Choice</strong>

On days when it is not perpetuating the Drug War or the Drone War, the White House is capably led by a former constitutional law professor from the University of Chicago. Such an academic background likely prepared Obama to quickly quell this debate by saying that Tsarnaev will not be treated as an enemy combatant, rather as the citizen he is.  The president also pointed out that under U.S. law, United States citizens cannot be tried in military commissions.

The President's choice was probably easy for him. Nonetheless, he deserves credit for making the right decision. Treating a U.S. citizen as an "enemy combatant" destroys our criminal justice system because any violent criminal could rightly be seen as an enemy combatant in the minds of friends and families of their victims. Tsarnaev made Obama look even better when he told agents that he and his brother were acting alone, independent of any foreign operatives. Furthermore, after Sandy Hook and Tuscon, Obama knows that to loved ones of the people killed and wounded in these crimes, they do feel like terrorism has been committed against them. Do you think former representative Gabrielle Giffords could make a convincing case that Jared Lee Loughner should qualify as an enemy combatant? Surly she could also argue that shooting indiscriminately in a crowded super market  with the intent to kill is not a common criminal enterprise, but merely an attempt to maim and kill innocent Americans.

A compelling argument could also be made against the jerk who shot the poor children at Sandy Hook, and their teachers. Is bombing an eight year old worse then shooting a six year old? To us, they all suck. Any time a U.S. citizen commits a crime which takes or severely maims a life, he or she has committed a crime against the country, and is thus, an enemy combatant. If you believe those shirts and newspapers that say "We are Boston," then you know that when you bleed, I bleed. We are Americans who know that the government can not possibly stop every crime against us citizens. Knowing that however, doesn't mean that we should encourage government to take legal shortcuts when it seems convenient.

Whether they intended to or not, Lindsey Graham, John McCain, and Kelly Ayotte proposed to aggressively weaken and punish law-abiding citizens by stripping away some of their rights to a fair trial should they ever be charged with committing a crime. Just like you're still an American when you travel to Canada, so too are you an American after you terrorize another American, all be it a completely shitty one who deserves to die or rot in jail.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The Associated Press had its main Twitter account hacked on the afternoon of April 23, 2013. The single hacked tweet which was sent out was a false news story that President Obama was injured in a White House explosion.<!--more--> The event unfavorably brought back memories of the “flash crash” of May 6, 2010. That day saw the stock market drop a 1,000 points in minutes. It did come back up a few minutes later, back up. The SEC investigation yielded that the crash was caused by an overtly large futures trade made by automated trading software.

Under new rules implemented after the 2010 crash, exchanges must stop trading in an individual stock for five minutes across U.S. stock markets when the stock experiences a 10% price or greater swing in the five-minute period  preceding the crash. Social Media outlets, which are monitored by big and small trading firms alike, already face complicated security challenges, and many are just learning how to come up with consistent rules to monitor the modern complexity and speed of computer trading systems. Social media hacking's ability to destabilize markets now presents another challenge, and perhaps, reminds us that machines sometimes make life faster, but when there's a problem, they can suck like sinus pain.

<b>Another Twitter Attack Could Look Like This</b>

We are going to invariably see markets dip from time to time because of a tweet. The reason for this is because of the computer programs which are designed to identify patterns through electronic algorithms. These algorithms are constantly monitoring social networks like Twitter the same way they do large corporate websites. These programs will refresh every few seconds, or faster to check these sites and networks for the newest information. On Twitter, an algorithm will look for trends, like a keyword that keeps popping up that's linked to a company. For example, if lots of tweets or retweets say that 500 people died at the ACME Chilli Company chilli cook off, it might be a sign that  ACME Chilli company was going to be in for rough times. If the trend happens fast enough, as was the case with the fake Obama tweet, the programs will react.

<b>Too Quick for Rhyme and Reason</b>

Immediately following the fake Obama tweet, there was a sharp drop in the U. S. stock market. The market rebounded just as quickly following news that the story had been false, but the event served as a reminder that the risks of relying on computerized labor, including trading. No important trader had time to make a basic phone call to confirm the news before the stock market fell. “And it wasn’t just the stock market. It was the bond market and commodity market and everything,” said Joseph Saluzzi, co-head of Themis Trading, an equity-trading firm . “The event," according to Saluzzi was done before humans could even process it.” Because computers play such a large part in the nearly 20 trillion dollar stock market, their power can not be left unchecked if long term stability is the market's essential goal.

The tweet which shocked the market read "Breaking: Two Explosions in the White House and Barack Obama is injured." Some who took it seriously can be forgiven because it was posted at 12:07 p.m. on the AP's official twitter account @AP. Upon posting, the tweet instantly got more than 3,000 retweets. The tweet caused the Dow Jones Industrial Average to fall more than 150 points. According to the Denver Post, in two minutes, the drop wiped out $136 billion from the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 index. After Jay Carney, Obama's press secretary, let the press know the president was safe, the market did return to normal levels.

<b> Too Fast to Fail?</b>

The fake tweet about Obama's attack impacted the market because trading firms will gather information in any place they can find it.  Traders monitor news channels, the Web, and use social media platforms like Facebook and Twitter to gain a price advantage over competition. The problem therein however, is that the markets depends on these companies ability to secure themselves.  This new news the comes from sources like Twitter is accompanies by now visible weaknesses such as that an official feed can be hacked, thereby triggering a rapid response in automated trading.

Thus the question becomes: is computerized trading too fast to fail? Can high-speed trading become the next Wall Street disaster the way that the banks have become? High-frequency trading is the constant moving of securities for tiny slivers of profit without being left with any product. The modern stock exchanges, according to Nick Bauman of <i>Mother Jones</i>, can execute trades in less than a half a millionth of a second—more than a million times faster than the human mind can make a decision. The current average holding period of a stock is five days. Less then fifty years ago, it was over five years. High-speed trading algorithms now responsible for over half the trading in the US. Computer orders are sent and canceled in mind benignly fast episodes in likely efforts to throw off the competition. Strategies like flooding the market with bogus trade orders to throw off competitors, or quick liquidations of large stock positions are common according to Bauman. Today's large scale trading therefore, depends not on how much the stock is worth, but how fast a trader can get rid of it.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>We Need to Let Iran Play Its Role in the Middle East</title>
		<link>http://stchicago.com/we-need-to-let-iran-play-its-role-in-the-middle-east/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Now that John Kerry has taken over for Hilary Clinton as Secretary of State,  he should start by shifting our policy positions towards Iran. Appointing Hilary to Secretary of State may have appeased the Democratic base in the US, but it did nothing for normalizing relations in the Middle East. Upon Clinton's departure, the Obama administration stands ready to do the real work towards bringing Iran in from the diplomatic cold. Iran has over 75 million college educated citizens, two-thirds of the world’s crude oil reserves, and should be allowed nuclear capability.<!--more-->

Though he's hardly a new Washington face, Kerry probably remembers back in 2008 when Obama spoke of hope that America would have diplomatic engagements with Iran rather then the cold unilateral financial sanctions against Iran imposed by President Bush. To bring Iran into the good diplomatic graces of the west, Kerry should advocate: formerly recognizing Iran; the lifting of the sanctions against Iran currently in place, and formerly declaring that military forces will not be the base of future conflict resolutions. With such an open door policy comes the ability to begin trade negotiations with the Iranians, as well as introduce foreign investors to local entrepreneurs. There is even a hand to be played by big American energy companies, who can also assist in expanding the Iranian oil industry.

<b>Lift the Sanctions</b>

First off, an open engagement with Iran, even an Iran with nuclear power, fits within the framework of past relationships between the U.S. relations and Iran.

After all, in 1953, President Eisenhower moved to subvert Iran's democratic regime led by Muhammad Mussadiq, who was gaining power against the regal Shah. The Shah, who was controlled by British oil interests and deep pockets, eventually fled to Rome before the CIA, and Britain's MI6's rolled in. The CIA then staged a Tehranian coup which brought down Mussadiq and restored the Shah. The Shah, with the blessing of Western Oil interests, would then began a quarter-century of political repression, torture, and killing. Naturally, these US acts left a deep impact on Iran, and should give us some patience for tolerating Iran's ambitions.

Secondly, an open relationship with Iran also serves the interest of strengthening international ties in the wider Middle East. Obama understands this, and in February of this year, he told Israeli's that Iranian relationships would be normalized. If Iran can be brought into the international diplomatic fold as a peaceful player, presumably by getting it to recognize Israel, it will remove Israel’s perpetual status as a victim of Iranian attacks.

Thirdly, for the United States, establishing peaceful ties with Iran will avoid a costly war with another Middle Eastern power. Instead of watching our brave men and women be wounded and killed, we can sit back and plan trips to what was formerly Persia. An open US/Iran relationship would likely diminish the perceived need for Iran to arm itself with nuclear weapons to protect themselves against Israel or the United States. American diplomatic involvement would also likely strengthen and grow the Iranian economy as well. Such a growing economy would also be welcomed as a friendly trading partner in the region.

<b>Skeptical Ain't Great, but It's Better Then What We Got</b>

Assuming that Turkey and Iraq will back us in talking with Iran, the US will need Turkish assistance in the region. Following the flotilla incident of 2010, when Israeli soliders attacked and killed nine Turkish requested three conditions from Israel: an official apology; compensation for people killed during that attack; and, Turkey wanted an end the blockade on Gaza. Things appeared dicey between the two nations, and Turkey even froze military agreements. However, money kept moving because trade, and some tourism continued. Some Turks, like some Arabs,  have started comparing Zionism with fascism, but then, something interesting happened. With Obama present, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, by phone, officially apologized to the Turkish Prime Minister. Netanyahu also; agreed to pay  for the those killed during the attack; and  partially lift the blockade on Gaza for consumer goods. Netanyahu's ability to swallow some humble pie, and promise to lift the siege is hard to believe for many Arabs, but their skeptical nature sure beats the unmitigated hatred they have for the sanctions. especially many Arabs are quite skeptical.

If Iran's feat of being addressed by the US is met with as much aplomb as Israel's apology was in Turkey, the Iranians' will see it as a diplomatic victory. Obama has spoked of this grander vision of the Middle East before, now he just has half as much time left to make it a reality. In talking with Iran, Obama can ask Iranian leaders to think of their own legacies. President Ahmadinejad of Iran, could have something that the Supreme Leader of Iran does not, a real role in improving his country’s society. If Achmadinejad greets Obama with openess, and vice verse, then we will eventually get the support of the Iranian people the anti-American rhetoric of the current leadership if we took this route.

As Kerry and Obama push forward, they must do so knowing that the domestic political landscape is sharply divided on foreign policy. The left base is unlikely to consider additional military action in the Middle East, and the right base is ready to get it on in the region under any conditions, including currently favoring military action in Syria and Iran. He can find some logical middle ground however, by reminding the American people that aggressive military action by us or Israel against Iran, will only temporarily stall Iran's quest for nuclear power. Allowing them this capability, which would be seen as being equivalent to our own nuclear power,  is perhaps the only thing that can create a sustaining pro-Western Iranian population.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>Would Your Team Sign Jason Collins?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When sports and social/cultural norms intersect, it can make for some impacting results. Jackie Robinson broke the color line through athletic achievement, but his path was partly paved by earlier efforts. Jesse Owens' gold in 1936 Berlin,  proved any ethnic line could be crossed.  And similarly, when Jason Collins came out a few weeks ago, sports and culture collided once again, as bravely became the first openly gay male athlete still competing in an American professional team sports. The path he took however, was partly paved by others.<!--more-->

<b>Praises Due</b>

Before Collins bravely faced the press, there was Martina Navratilova. While she differed from Collins in that she was competing in an individual sport, and she competed at a much higher level in her field, she still had to worry about being stalked by homophobic fans and rival supporters. Sure Navratilova didn't have to deal with the dreaded "locker room" scenario of showering with straight teammates, but when she came out in 1981, she was only 24, and acted against the wishes of her employer, the Womens' Tennis Association. The NBA oppositely, encouraged Collins. Navratilova was also just nine days away from her court hearing to become a U.S. citizen. Seeking political asylum from the Communist Czechoslovakian government of the time, she was determined to live her life openly in her new homeland. That lifestyle however, was hardly in sync with the norms of American society in the early 80's.

Unlike now, the majority of Americans, including President Reagan, favored marriage inequality when Navratilova came out. There were not many straight athletes allying themselves with gay rights, and Jack Tripper was the closest you could get to a gay character in a sitcom. Perhaps most devastating of all, AIDS was joked about and targeted as a gay's only disease. Also, unlike Collins when he came out, Navratilova was in the prime of her career, and as a major superstar, stood to pay a considerable endorsement price for her open declaration of sexual preference. Navratilova's struggles however, have opened the doors of tolerance in some professional sports as evidenced by the scarcely noticed coming out of basketball phenom Britney Griner on the eve of her draft selection.  George Stephanapolous didn't try and get Briner on his Sunday show, but Jason Collins, bam! To his credit, Collins acknowledged the role Navratilova played in his ability to come out, telling Sports Illustrated's Jon Wertheim that "[t]he words thank you aren't enough."

<b>He Needs a Brave GM</b>

As he is not in the prime of his career, Jason Collin's basketball future is now dependent on his 34 year old body holding up in a young man's game, and a team willing to take the somewhat radical step of signing the first openly gay male professional athlete. As the GM of a team, it may intriguing or problematic to sign Collins. Inking a deal with Jason now is different then previous off seasons. It may not be Tebow size, but there will be heavy media crush paying close attention to any team that signs him, and asking all sorts of question that having little to do with basketball. Players could also be asked questions that they feel embarrassed about, or may not be prepared to answer maturely or respectfully. And sadly, by signing Collins, a GM will be exciting many fans, but may also be upsetting many others.

The flip side is that any GM that does sign Collins gets to be the Branch Rickey of the NBA. Corporate sponsorship opportunities will certainly present themselves, and any gay NBA fans who don't have a home team will follow the team with Collins. In markets like Miami, New York, and Golden State, Collins signing could be met with a great deal of postivity. Signing in Oklahoma City for example, or Memphis, may create a greater challenge. Would your team sign him?

That being said, Collins’ decision to come out likely reflects the more tolerant nature of contemporary society. Collins is going to be regarded in the future not just for being the first gay player, but as the player who gave the opportunity to younger gay players to feel more confident about coming out earlier in their careers. Some fans and players may be intolerant, but ultimately, if Collins can still ball at a high level, teams who need a big reserve will have a harder time explaining why they didn't sign him, instead of why they did.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[This new game of thorny American politics is mind numbingly dull for those of us who wish for effective governance from our federal legislature. Instead, political posturing, especially with events that take place on foreign soil in the middle of the ongoing war against Middle East terrorism, prevents us from getting to the facts which really matter, and also weakens our credibility abroad. The Benghazi hearings should have been used to learn lessons about the tragic death of the four Americans killed in the line of duty, and to use those lessons to protect the lives of other staff at American embassies and international government facilities. Instead, it became a sideshow that has not shed more light on the suspected group or groups who carried out the attack, but has become rather, an opportunity for the GOP to take early 2016 pot shots at Hilary Clinton. So far, she seems unscathed. The Republicans on the other hand, are left backtracking.<!--more-->

Just yesterday, 2012 Republican Vice Presidential Candidate and current congressman Paul Ryan, exemplified the Republican's mixed stance on Libya. Ryan had been telling conservative radio hosts that he had "no doubts" about Obama's involvement in a cover up about Benghazi. When Fox News asked him however, whether he had any reason reason to believe the White House purposely misled the American people on Benghazi, Ryan could not answer affirmatively, and quietly told Chris Wallace he doesn't know how to answer the question.

Republicans have been spending so much time trying to create the Benghazi scandal when it wasn't there, that they even managed to mute the real scandal over the IRS snooping on the tea-party. Obama's poll-numbers have remained constant during these weeks of turmoil most likely due to the fact that our society is so polarized from previous GOP attack lines, that sides have already been drawn.

Americans are also getting weary of hearing about screw ups that didn't really happen. Many Americans with tools like Google, are now aware that ambassador Chris Stevens was not at an American Embassy when he was killed, but at a consulate. While embassies and consulates refer to government representations in foreign lands, any country will have only one American embassy, which is heavily fortified, while it may have multiple consulates in various cities that feature considerably less protection.

So, the attack in Benghazi was not an attack on an American Embassy, and, had it been an attack on an American embassy, it would only have been the third under Obama. According to <a href="http://stablenytimes.com/">Stablenytimes.com</a>, there have been two embassy attacks and 4 deaths under Obama, whereas under Bush there were eleven embassy attacks and 52 deaths. Democrats never made the incidents a political football, and thus, the public is only catching on to such attacks existing now.

Meanwhile, this Republican fear mongering on Benghazi is coming at a time when the party is publicly attempting to rebrand itself. It doesn't need old dogs playing old tricks. but the old dogs like Karl Rove, are playing old tricks. Through his American Crossroads super PAC, Rove is spending large chunks of change blasting Clinton on her handling of the Libya attack, without actually offering any proof of incompetence.

Some Republicans did urge restraint as they looked at the facts and realized that the tragic events at the consulate were largely under the discretion of the CIA. Additionally, the CIA was largely responsible for giving Susan Rice the false information about the possible relationship between the attack and a video which she used on the Sunday talk shows.

Republican and former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates told CBS that he would have handled Benghazi in a similar fashion to Obama. When asked if Hilary Clinton could be involved in a cover-up, Gates answered "no". Even Bill Kristol, a conservative's conservative told Fox News he "wishes the Republicans would just be quiet for a while and that the partisan Republican groups that are fundraising off [Benghazi] would be quiet."

<b>Your New Look Republicans</b>

The Republicans desire to tarnish Obama and Clinton with this incident also underlies the fact that Democrats are now the cold blooded drone killers, while the Republicans have become the party that is mainly concerned with stopping abortions and crying over the deaths of diplomats voluntarily serving in a conflict zone. Chris Stevens' death is a shame, but he is not the first diplomat killed in the line of duty, and he will not be the last.

By calling the events in Benghazi a scandal, the right has left themselves vulnerable to public scrutiny over conservative fiscal measures in the years of 2011 and 2012, when the Republican-led House of Representatives voted to remove nearly half a billion dollars from embassy and consulate security funding projects. Why didn't they fight so hard against Obama back then for making cuts to embassy security? Why wait for Stevens to die?

The new-look Republicans have taken the old line in the sand approach that says Obama either directly knew that the embassy was attacked by a coordinated strike and deliberately tried to hide that fact from the press, or that Secretary of State Hilary Clinton, failed to deal adequately with prioritizing our security efforts. If  politics happened in a court of law, this would amount to a whole bunch of allegations without any substantiation. But since our politicians get to make laws without really having to understand our legal system, they know that made-up scandals are almost as dangerous as real ones. For example, what happened to Jon McCain's black daughter? The sad truth is that once again, Republicans want Obama to fight against them for the American people, not with them.  For all of us, that song and dance should have ended after the 2012 elections.]]></content:encoded>

				<title>What&#039;s the Big Rowhani?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="line-height: 1.5;">Two months ago, this post welcomed the appointment of Senator John Kerry as Secretary of State, and specifically called for the former Massachusetts Senator to begin courting a more diplomatic relationship with Iran. As he is in the Middle East this week, we hope he talks with leaders in the region about the recent victory of moderate Iranian Prime-minister Hassan Rowhani, which could and should offer the West more reason to feel encouraged about a more normal diplomatic relationship with Iran. Rowhani has intimated that his administration will feature more cooperation with the United States, such cooperation he said though, only comes if the US: allows Iran to continue through with its nuclear ambitions; stops interfering with Iranian internal affairs; and the US end its oppressive sanctions.</span>

The sanctions have hurt the people in Iraq by crippling the economy and propping up the corrupt government, and also the Western economies which do business there. Sanctions have shrunk Iran's oil sales and have left the country isolated from international banking. Rohani, who is said to be one of Iran’s leading foreign policy experts, knows he has to take some initiatives that will change Iran's deepening isolation. Economic hardship, rising unemployment, a devalued currency and soaring inflation are making ordinary Iranians nervous, and hurting any big business willing to invest there. Both MTN and Sasol, two large South African multinationals with investments in Iran, have been seen crippling financial hits as a result of western sanctions imposed in response to Iran’s nuclear ambitions.

Iran's nuclear issues, and disastrous relationship to Israel, are the most significant obstacles to an improved relationship between the US and Iran. Yet, if under this new leader, Iran is willing to provide the world with open inspections of its nuclear facilities, the West must be able to trust Iran, and ease up on the sanctions. Earlier this week, Rohani said he would pursue moderate policies, including making the nation’s nuclear programme more transparent. However, he also said the US must recognise all the rights of the Islamic republic, including its nuclear rights.

Iran has the legal right to enrich uranium for under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty, or NPT, which has been enforced globally since 1970. Iran, while going about their nuclear business in a quiet, and rather salacious kind of way, has maintained that its enrichment program is part of a civilian nuclear energy program, allowable under Article IV of the NPT.

As illustrated by the large margin of Rohani's victory, many people in Iran are in favor of some issues of Westernization. He garnered more than 50 percent of the votes, over 18.5 million votes went to him. Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf, Tehran's mayor, took second place with only 6 million. Accordingly, Rohani has said that will look to heal old wounds with the west.

To clean the wounds, Rohani will need to let more pro-Western voices be heard in and through Iran's government institutions, especially with respect to Nuclear power and Israel. He must be more transparent as he spearheads Iran's insistence on the continued development of nuclear power as a condition of better relations with the West. And while Iran's tensions with Israel are likely to remain for a while, Rohani the necessary hubris a leader in the region needs in order to stave off a war with Israel. Because any war with Iran would be horrible for us, Iran, Israel, and the world, we're going to have to suck it up and let Iran join the nuclear bullies in the lunchroom.

The Iran that is coming to the table now is probably feeling pretty good about itself. It is likely that the Iranian people, much like we did in 2009 following Obama's first Presidential victory, are basking in a sense of hope. When elections result in new leadership which is markedly different from the old, citizens tend to believe that the course of the country is changing for the better. Iran, like us in 2008, could use some good news, because at this point, Iran is suffering with double-digit unemployment, a high degree of government corruption, and a sluggish patronage laced economy.

These are enormous challenges for us and Iran, but our nations are not so dissimilar. Two-thirds of the adult population are college educated, and the pressures for socio-economic stability will be part of an upcoming push for reforms which allow more access to success. More then likely, any social gains Rohani makes could be checked by the conservative theological rulers. The Islamic Republic's policies on matters such as its nuclear program, and relations with the US  are decided by the Supreme Council, above the president's level. The Ayatollah Khamenei and his circle of advisers typically decide the direction of these policies, and the president carries them out.

Rohani's victory does not mean that Iran will change, but it does represent Iran's desire for a change in the way the rest of the world views the Iranian Republic. During his campaign, Mr. Rohani said the U.S. was similar to the world's "village elder,"  and someone that Iran should be talking with. How's that for some new diplomacy with Tehran?

				<title>Obamacare is Working</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[When Justice John Roberts authored the 5-4 2012 Supreme Court decision upholding the Affordable Care Act, ( Obamacare ) many conservatives felt betrayed and upset. However, as of this month, Republican governors Terry Branstad of Iowa, and Jan Brewer of Arizona will be the eighth and ninth Republican governors to sign their states on to Obamacare.<!--more--> Brandstad and Brewer, who are deeply conservative, join other conservative governors from Florida, Michigan, New Mexico, North Dakota, Ohio, and Nevada who have come out in favor of expanding Medicaid coverage for their states. The fact that Republican governors are supporting Obamacare shouldn't be seen as shocking. Economists like Paul Krugman believe that "important new evidence — especially from California, the law’s most important test case — suggests that Obamacare will be a success."

Furthermore, Obamacare is a deeply conservative reform because it does very little to change the current state of health care, leaving most people’s health coverage unaffected. Thus, the vast majority of covered Americans who receive their health insurance from their employers, Medicare or Medicaid, will see very little change when the law goes into effect.<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/opinion/krugman-the-obamacare-shock.html?hp&amp;_r=1&amp;"><b>
</b></a>

Perhaps the eight remaining Republican governors who are refusing to increase the eligibility levels for their states should remember that it was a Republicans who started this whole Obamacare idea thing in the first place. Back in 2006, Governor Mitt Romney started a statewide health care program in Massachusetts, and in 2010, Republican Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger of California legally established the first online insurance marketplace, or "exchange.” Arnold's exchanges are the key ingredient of President Obama’s health-care reform. Upon implementing the law’s Medicaid expansion, California has seen it's uninsured population decline from 20 percent to less than five.<b> </b>

Some of this republican love for Obamacare is likely due to positive feedback from constituents, on both sides of the isle, that says Obamacare is working. Kenneth P. Thomas, a Political Science professor at the University of Missouri-St. Louis, said that almost 13 million Americans have received rebates from insurance companies due to the fact that their premiums were higher then the amount of actual health care they received.<b> </b>Additionally, no American man, woman, or child can be denied access to health insurance based on a pre-existing conditions.

Just like Brandstad, New Jersey Gov., and once Republican Mega-star Chris Christie, also welcomed Obamacare into New Jersey society. Expanding Medicaid, explained Christie, represented fiscal prudence. The $300 million or so his state stood to receive from Obamacare's measures for increased federal funding to the states who add more low-income residents to their Medicaid rolls was an offer Christie couldn't refuse.<a href="http://thinkprogress.org/health/2013/02/26/1642121/chris-christie-medicaid/)"><b>
</b></a>

In the move to announce his alignment with Obamacare, Christie said that his decision was based on his desire to put "people first.” In his budget address to the city, which included the Obamacare association, he said New Jersey had "an opportunity to ensure that an even greater number of New Jerseyans at or near the poverty line will have access to critical health services beginning in January 2014.” Big Chris was also likely paying attention to what has been happening in California and Massachussets, the two states who have adopted Obamacare the longest.

In the past few years, the health insurance companies of California and Massachussetts, who base their pricing options on the states' exchanges, submitted pricing requests that were much lower then previously estimated. Accordingly, the free market is doing its job. Quality goes up or stays the same, prices go down, everybody wins. Republicans in general, as the defenders of the free market, need to be more friendly about this fact.

If Republican governors continue to act as road blocks to affordable health care in their states, they will likely be seen not just as obstructionists, but as  responsible for hurting the people who are too poor to afford health coverage. Such poor Americans could be covered by a federally financed expansion of Medicaid, but in the eight states where Republicans have blocked Medicaid expansion, many uncovered Americans will be out of luck.

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Hopefully, most people already knew that the following was true: gay people deserve to be treated with the same rights as straight people.<!--more-->  Thanks to the very recent majority ruling in the <i>United States vs. Windsor</i>  Supreme Court case, authored by Justice Kennedy, the law of the country now recognizes that the Defense of Marriage Act's (DOMA), "principal effect is to identify and make unequal a subset of state-sanctioned marriages. It contrives to deprive some couples married under the laws of their State, but not others, of both rights and responsibilities, creating two contradictory marriage regimes within the same State."

Kennedy gets props for writing this decision, and so do Justices Sotomayor, Kagan, Breyer, and Ginsburg for joining him. Thankfully, as with health care, one conservative justice decided to rule with the liberals, and this wacky court has a found their way to some common sense. Had the Court defined marriage as a heterosexual union, their decision would have violated the rights of married gay couples by denying them government benefits, straight up and down. DOMA, wrote Kennedy for the majority, “places same-sex couples in an unstable position of being in a second-tier marriage." “The differentiation," reasoned Kennedy, "demeans the couple, whose moral and sexual choices the Constitution protects, and whose relationship the state has sought to dignify.”

While there are certainly some people in this world who are still trying to figure out just exactly how gay marriage is assaulting their straight marriage, the rest of us likely welcomed the Supreme Court's decision in <i>Windsor</i>.  The finality that the Supreme Court’s decision brings to an issue which still confounds so many is very real, and will likely never be taken away.  Following the ruling, gay couples have the comfort of knowing that they will be treated equally like any married couple.

For married gay couples in states that recognize same-sex marriage, the decision means access to over a thousand federal benefits like filing joint income tax returns, receiving Social Security benefits, and military spousal benefits. The impact is more unclear in states like Missouri, where there exists a constitutional amendment banning gay marriage, and Illinois, a state which recognizes civil unions but doesn’t allow for same sex marriage. So, for example, a same-sex couple that was married and living in a state like Massachusetts which recognizes same sex marriage, would be able to receive Social Security benefits. That same couple however, if they were married in Massachusetts, but lived in Missouri for work, could not receive the benefits. The Court's opinion made clear that they wanted an act of Congress for that type of federal change.

The opposition is likely shocked, as now hell has legally frozen over. Amongst the dissenting justices, was the notorious Antonin Scalia. This of course is unsurprising given that Scalia's theory of civil rights likely involves an imaginary  paradise of straight, WASPY people. His showcased such ideas a day after the <i>Windsor</i> verdict when he was part of the majority that voted to overturn the most significant portion of the Voting Rights Act. Justices like Scalia and Roberts do not believe that racial minorities, or gays, continue to face barriers to voting or getting married in states with a history of discrimination. Accordingly, Scalia's dissent was the real "argle bargle" as he used it to throw salt at the gay rights movement, and berate the court for even weighing in on the issue.

Scalia, who clearly should have been asked to play Gargamel in the Smurf movies, accused the majority of having "declar[ed] anyone opposed to same-sex marriage an enemy of human decency." "We have no power to decide this case, . . . even if we did, we have no power under the Constitution to invalidate this democratically adopted legislation. The Court’s errors on both points spring forth from the same diseased root: an exalted conception of the role of this institution in America.” His use of the term "diseased root" is pernicious, but then again, so is he.

Scalia further writes that the court is committing judicial supremacy by setting rules of the road that won't allow legislators to discriminate against consenting adults who choose to exercise their right of liberty, by selecting their own partners, equally under they eyes of the law, regardless of how they get it on. Judicial supremacy from the highest court in the land, clearly Scalia shouldn't be shocked.

As celebrations ensue across the country, it is worth remembering good ol' Joe Biden, who kicked the gay marriage debate into high gear with the comment that he was "comfortable" with gay marriage, while Obama was still officially "evolving" on the issue. "I am vice president of the United States of America," Biden told NBC's Meet The Press. "The President sets the policy," Biden said, "[but] I am absolutely comfortable with the fact that men marrying men, women marrying women, and heterosexual men and women marrying another are entitled to the same exact rights, all the civil rights, all the civil liberties. And quite frankly, I don't see much of a distinction -- beyond that." Obama then followed suit, then Hilary, and before long, there was real momentum.

The decision will produce positive, quick results, and already has. On the morning the verdict was announced, a New York City Immigration judge stopped deportation proceedings against a Colombian man married to a gay American citizen after he found out about the Court's ruling on DOMA. According to the DOMA project's Facebook page, the ruling which their intern had run over to the court and delivered to the judge  "was still warm from the printer."

As a result of the Court's findings in <i>Windsor</i>, the inherent inequality between gay and straight marriages within the same state for purposes such as taxes and benefits, is now equal under the eyes of the law. DOMA was discriminating against state-sanctioned marriages by creating two contradictory marriage regimes within the same State, and now gay Americans have found that the highest court in the land cares for their "dignity" as Kennedy put it, and will not allow a class of citizens to harmed in states where legislators and citizens have intentionally set out to protect them.

According to the Associated Press, just two weeks after the Court's <i>Windsor</i> decision, the American Civil Liberties Union, (ACLU) is bringing the decision to  bare on the state level in Pennsylvania against that state's same-sex marriage ban. Part of the ACLU's efforts are also aimed at preventing state officials there from creating legislative road blocks that will further challenge same-sex couples seeking a legal marriage. The Washington Post reports that 23 plaintiffs will be part of this lawsuit, including gay couples, children of gay couples, and the widow of a same-sex couple that was together for 29 years, similar to the defendant in <i>Windsor, </i>who was with her partner for over thirty years.

We at Saint Chicago applaud the bench for valuing relationships, and mandating that any American relationship be respected like everybody else's.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[As George Zimmerman becomes a right wing hero, and Trayvon Martin's parents attempt to put their lives back together, it is clear that Florida, and other states with similar laws, must repeal their "Stand Your Ground" self-defense legislation. The law perpetuates both unnecessary violence, and unnecessary violence directed at non-whites. <!--more-->Tragedies like the fatal shooting of Martin, an unarmed black teenager by a white guy playing cop, are currently justified under the law. As President Obama pointed out when he compared himself to a young Trayvon Martin, had Martin had a gun, would he have been legally able to shoot Zimmerman who was following Martin in his car? Not sure how you could not say that Martin would have been justified under the law if he had had a gun to shoot the guy who was creeping up on him.

According to the Rachel Maddow Show, the "Stand Your Ground" law has been recognized in Florida courts to support shooting someone who is already on the ground, and shooting someone in the back of the head. The law encourages certain people who are either hatred, or violence prone, to shoot their way out of situations and into situations. It blurs the legal line that is the barometer of our civilization. Provoking someone into a fight can lead to your ability to shoot them because you claim you were scared to death and standing your ground. This type of shoot-first theorizing not only sounds good to the NRA, but it brings up the scary reality that a mentality of civil militias is starting to permeate states like Florida.

According to the jury instructions in the Zimmerman trial, Zimmerman had "no duty to retreat and had the right to stand his ground and meet force with force" if he reasonably feared for his life or suffering imminent, great bodily harm. Without the law, Zimmerman would have had a duty to retreat to safe ground if he were able to ever gain the high ground. It would seem to me that once a gun is drawn upon someone, the upper hand is gained, saved for a few Jackie Chan movies.

"Stand Your Ground" was not specifically cited as part of Zimmerman's defense, but there is little doubt that the jury instructions helped pave the way for his acquittal. The truth will always be that Trayvon Martin was killed for wearing a hooded sweatshirt, eating skittles, and being black. More accurately, he was black in the wrong place and time, which apparently is still a grave crime in this country, and in this century. The underlying message by the police and defense in the case said that a white man like Zimmerman has the right to self-defense but a young black male like Martin, does not. The verdict leaves us with the uncomfortable truth that in this country, a white person is still justified in fearing a black person to death if they have to go at each other in a fist to fist fight. Will this theory work when the racial roles were reversed. At least in Florida, the fact that the young black Martin could have been, and likely was in fear for his life, seems to be completely lost on people.

&nbsp;

<strong>What Should Have Happened</strong>

Following the recusal of the Seminole County district attorney and multiple judges, the state's lawyers should have made motion for a change of venue where the judge would have faced less local political pressures, and therefore be unsusceptible to election issues following a guilty Zimmerman verdict. This is no easy task, as a change of venue takes place only when the judge sees such overwhelming support against the defendant that it would prejudice the case. Whether that happened here is debatable, although I'm sure the lawyers could have made pretty strong prejudicial grounds by showing how the local police had already let the defendant go for 24 hours. Additionally, one of the jurors felt so close to the defendant that the juror told CNN's Anderson Cooper that she referred to the defendant by his first name, "George."

Due to the Stand Your Ground laws, and the fact that the other party privy to the happenstance had been killed, this case was not an easy case. Prosecutors appeared disinterested however, allowing the "yes" answer, of the Sanford police officer who was asked if he believed Zimmerman's story of self-defense, to ride for 24 hours without the prosecution objecting. Witnesses should not be permitted to offer an opinion on the credibility of a story coming from another witnesses. The next day when prosecutors asked the judge to strike that portion, she did, but the jury had heard and seen what it needed.

<b>Why Black People Are So Upset</b>

Contemporary racism is a well documented issue: the list of hits includes: segregated housing lending; racial profiling,; legally attacking affirmative action gains, and supplemental nutrition programs; excessive police brutality against minorities; and the overwhelming history of slavery and segregation.  As President Obama acknowledged, this trial and verdict strikes a resonating chord within us all, especially for black men, or those of us who hang out with black men at night. We see this story through a different set of experiences.

See the thing is, following the conclusion of the Civil War, and the beginning of modern American racism as we know it, white people decided the best way to deal with the stain of slavery was to sweep it under the rug, or put it behind the big old grandfather clock in the hallway. Evidence of such practice surfaced recently when Purdue University President Mitch Daniel's had to deal with surfaced emails which showed Daniels, when he was governor of Indiana, wanted to prevent Howard Zinn's "A People's History of the United States" from being used in K-12 classrooms. The emails mention that he wants to "disqualify" the text, and that he refers to the book as "propaganda." For those who don't know, it's the book from the bar scene in <i>Good Will Hunting</i> when Matty Damon schools the Harvard guy.

Instead of focusing on the impact slavery had on black people who had no control over their situation, white America has perfected the practice of surrounding itself with the idea that a contemporary positive outlook on life and race is better then adequately confronting the problem head on. For example, in Germany, there are Holocaust laws that teach Germans about their awful involvement under Hitler, so very few people believe that Jews in Europe need to get over the Holocaust. White American people have had no significant mistreatment of their own, nothing to overcome except problems they created, so it is harder for them to develop empathy. Poor jobs numbers also don't help old wounds.

Thus, we here at Saint Chicago can not be shocked by the Martin verdict. A jury with only one black male American said that the killing of a black male teenager was justified because  our country still perpetuates the narrative that a young, agile, weed smoking black man is out to do terrible things, and should instill the fear of god into any white person who is presumably doing wonderful things, like assaulting a black kid for walking home and eating skittles.

In fairness to those who believe that race had nothing to do with this case, it is true that the way the Stand Your Ground Law is phramed, all the person has to do is say they were in fear of their life, and the shooting becomes justified. So, while there may have been no racism at all in this case, it does come down to the fact that an unarmed black teenager is enough of a threat to someone to with a gun that it justifies killing the black teenager if a scuffle occurs.

So, Americans will keep on  claiming that that they aren't racists,  yet still believe that Obama is a Kenyan, and black teenagers are all thugs. Our country is sadly still as Richard Wright described her in his novel <i>Black Boy</i>- “Our too-young and too-new America, lusty because it is lonely, aggressive because it is afraid, insists upon seeing the world in terms of good and bad, the holy and the evil, the high and the low, the white and the black; our America is frightened of fact, of history, of processes, of necessity. It hugs the easy way of damning those whom it cannot understand, of excluding those who look different, and it salves its conscience with a self-draped cloak of righteousness.”

So Trayvon Martin punched this neighborhood watchmen in the face, does mean the watchmen can shoot him dead?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<span style="line-height: 1.5;">If insanity is truly doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results, then Anthony Weiner is insane. As a result of revelations this summer that he continued sexual online relations with women other then his wife following his resignation from congress, Weiner is now in last place in his bid to become New York City Mayor. His candidacy has become a sideshow as he's campaigning while still having to answer questions about his online activity. Weiner, aka Carlos Danger, can likely now be found in one of the five boroughs,  bellying up to podiums to defend and discuss his views on middle class America and job production. He's trying to talk in public about these things, but instead, the main thrust of his candidacy is again, his internet sex life, and the state of his marriage to Huma Abedin, a close advisor to Hilary Clinton. Now that people have seen the Good Wife,  Abedin looks a lot more like Julia Margolies, than she does her powerful former boss. </span>

As Weiner continues his New York City mayoral bid, the first question that must be answered is why's the guy running? Besides looking for a public redemption, he claims having a child changed him for the better, and will make him a better mayor. That family who changed him for the better however, which coincided with his time away from politics, is now being thrust, by Weiner's own doing, back onto the world stage.

The second question is how did Weiner think he was going to get away with the same type of behavior that forced him to resign from congress. Instead of acting seriously towards amending his marriage, by perhaps joining a sex therapy program, or even lampooning himself in the media for the absurdity and stupidity of his own actions, Weiner decided that a year or so away from the public limelight was enough of a punishment.

Weiner, although he could have, and probably should have, joked about his online activities, did not. He neither laughed at himself nor at his behavior. Therefore, neither did we, until the light night hosts and political pundits started doing the joke telling for us.  Thus, the conclusion most of us have reached is that Anthony Weiner has psychiatric problems that cause him to act out online in sexually lewd ways. To the best of our knowledge, and his, that behavior is still a problem for him. He also has a very strong wife who will seemingly support him and his ambitions in the face of anything. While this is generally a strong asset, in this case, it almost makes her look Macbethian, as if this power couple has bigger plans then any one scandal can take down.

Weiner continues to say that "[w]hile some things that have been posted . . . are true and some are not, . . . what I did was wrong. This behavior is behind me. I've apologized to Huma and am grateful that she has worked through these issues with me and for her forgiveness. [W]e are focused on moving forward.” Time will tell if Weiner can truly move forward, in both in his marriage and his political career, but it was worth noting that sexual scandals and politicians are by no means strangers, but this one does seem to be in a league of its own. It appears this way because it's our first social networking scandal, and the evidence is available for the world to see.

What Weiner does have going for him is the fact that there have been no alleged actual sexual affairs in this scandal, as well as that all of Weiner's philandering was non-physical, consensual, and done in the privacy of of his own home. Thus, Wiener's scandal seems to be less sleazy then say your average John Edwards, or Bill Clinton drama, which is why the the guy probably sees a light at the end of the tunnel. In Clinton's case, he really did cheat on his wife, lied about it, and still, much to the delight of Anthony Weiner,  remains one of America's most popular politicians.

Republicans too, are no strangers to sex scandals. Mark Sanford finished his term as governor of South Carolina after admitting to a real sexual affair. Despite his wife leaving him, South Carolina voters forgave him by recently electing him to Congress earlier this year. Former Nevada senator, John Ensign,  was forced to resign a few years ago after it was revealed that had been having an affair with one of his aide's wife. He tried to cover it up by having his parents pay the couple nearly $100,000, and trying to get the aide a lobbying job in D.C.. And last but not least, Louisiana's David Vitter, was caught frequenting a prostitute, and still managed to keep his job running as an evangelical. So the road to redemption is bipartisan, but it's a hard road, and unfortunately for Weiner, the New York Media can be unrelenting.

The New York Times editorial board, as well as a plethora of Democratic party leaders, have been calling for Weiner to drop out of the mayoral race. Despite doing nothing against the law, Weiner is being asked to quit because he has become an embarrassment to New York City. Thus, a third question must be asked. Is this current mayoral scandal worse then Rudy's? Rudy Giulliani wasn't forced to step down when it was found out that in 1999, while mayor, he was cheating on his second wife, and he was using public money and the icy police force to carry on his affair. Public records indicate that there were city-financed trips to Southampton where his girlfriend had a condo, and city payments for undercover cops to escort his girlfriend around town.

According to realchange.org, the scandal was covered up by the Giuliani administration, and the expenses were hidden "by billing the money to obscure city agencies with no connection to security -- such as the Office of People With Disabilities, the Loft Board, and the Community Assistance Unit." Giulliani used some of the money from the obscure billing practices to pre-pay almost half a million dollars on to an American Express card which he then used to pay for hotels, meals, and gas on trips with his girlfriend. Additionally, realchange.com claims that Guiliani even made two police detectives walk his girlfriend's dog. Yes, New York's finest, scooping up poop from the mayor's mistress' pooch.

New York voters who will decide Weiner's fate, also have to grapple with the fact that even without the sex scandal, Weiner is at best a narcissistic, but ambitious  congressional deadweight. A July front-page New York Times story detailing Anthony Weiner’s time on the hill theorized that those who knew him best, said that Weiner "was a go-it-alone politician whose legislative record was thin and whose restlessness could spill into recklessness. He smartly selected issues on which to weigh in but left the difficult legislating to others."

Weiner's lack of congressional accomplishments are highlighted by the ineptitude of his time on the congressional immigration subcommittee. As Latino New Yorkers ask Weiner to elaborate on his achievements, or lack thereof, on behalf of immigration reform, he is left blaming only the Bush years, and the frenetic xenophobia that followed 9/11.  During the health care fight, the Times reported that Weiner "threatened behind the scenes to torpedo the [ Affordable Health Care Act] package," backing away only after being promised a bigger share of the debate spotlight. This all of course, may just be shrewd politics, but it also smells of smallness, similar indeed, to the stench left by Carlos Danger's online banter.

Reading some of the exchanges that Weiner had with the 23 year old woman from Chicago is like drinking year old milk and listening to it curdle in your stomach. This guy actually told her he wanted to leave his wife, and buy her a condo in Chicago. Up to this point, Weiner is so lucky just to have his wife's support. If she leaves, which she probably will, he is done. But, for all practical purposes, he's done already. After all, New Yorkers know that the only thing worse then not keeping your dick in your pants, is being a total dick.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[President Bararck Obama addressed the nation this week in prime time, speaking directly to the American people about the situation in Syria. The situation in Syria, for those just tuning in, is as follows. In the past two years and change, the uprising in Syria has caused the deaths of over 110,000 Syrian people, with at least 40,000 civilians killed. Among this second group are thousands of innocent women and children. Additionally, over 20,000 rebel fighters have been killed, over 25,000 government soliders, and 15,000  mercenaries fighting for the Assad government. President Obama deserves a little skepticism because of his willingness to let events in the Middle East run the course they were running under Bush 43, but his urgency to get into Syria is understandable because as of August, people are being gassed like the Jews in Auschwitz, or the American Indians in the late 1690's by the British.

Bashar al-Assad, whose Syrian regime is being fought by the Rebels, and Vladimir Putin, Russia's prime-minister who is a friend of the regime, admits that chemical gases were used in Damascus, the capital of Syria. They are saying however, it was done by the rebel fighters, a group, which according to the Huffington Post, "relies on a network of activists, doctors and lawyers on the ground throughout Syria." Obama, with far more access to information on this matter then the general public, is convinced it was Assad's people who initiated the attack. So yes, even for the most ardent of anti-war believers, which includes us at this site, it is hard to sit idly by as innocent women and children are slaughtered due to a poisonous gas. It's the type of military move that shows no character, and above all, the world as one must stand for a unified front of respecting the innocent among us.

At the time Obama addressed the nation,  ABC news was indicating that 60% of the country is opposed to military intervention in the Syrian conflict. Accordingly, the president was in the position of having to defend his "redline" stance, and convince the nation that military intervention was in our best interests.

The president poignantly referenced the history of chemical weapons, which have been used against our soldiers, and those of our allies in both World Wars. He was right to do so. Many of us have forgotten that gassing used to be a regular war activity, going back as far World War I which was known as "the chemists' war," because of the deadly gases that were introduced to combat during the theater. At the Second Battle of Ypres, yellow-green chlorine gas was deployed by German troops. Yellow-Green chlorine is a choking agent that causes fluid to build up in the lungs of the victims.  National Geographic reports that several hundred French soldiers were killed in such a shocking manner that it has been suggested that the German soldiers themselves were so shocked by the chlorine gas' effects "that they failed to make an advance." (http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2013/08/130822. )

More recently, and closer to Syria, Iraq, in the eighties, used nerve gas against Kurdish Iraqis in the north, killing thousands of Kurds with deadly sarin and VX gas. These two gases in particular, are among the chemical weapons in Syria's suspected arsenal.

If you have chosen not to watch some of the video evidence that is out there, indicating that chemical weapons were used by Bashar Assad's government, you probably can look at this situation like a typical third party conflict that we, the United States, should refrain from joining. Ten year old stained memories from our poor decision to invade Iraq have likely made Americans more skeptical about Middle East military maneuvers. However, as Obama said in his prime time address, the gassings in Syria "can not be erased from memory." You should watch some of the videos. Keith Ellison, the very anti-war Democratic congressman from Minneapolis has said that if Obama would release half of the evidence which congress has been shown, then the American people would be more supportive of a strike.

Any action, we are being told, will be limited in scope, meaning neither "boots on the ground," nor a heavy U.S. military presence in Syria. But what we hear, is what we know.  There will be deaths, and there will be costs. The types of limited military operations that Obama could order in Syria, such as cruise missile strikes on military targets, may be more practical then sustained air force campaigns aimed at regime change. But no matter what happens, any action will effect America, including the likely impacts of higher fuel prices.

In making the case for a limited military response to Syria’s use of chemical weapons, Obama can not say that he is choosing between he best of bad options, which, unfortunately,  is exactly what he's doing. And Obama's firmness seems to be working, because it led to Assad doing the “I didn’t order chemical attacks” routine in his interview with Charlie Rose, and there's no way Assad does that interview if he didn’t think the United States was serious. Obama's threat was also strong enough to force Russia to offer a plan to put Syria’s weapons under international control, a move they almost certainly would have avoided had they not felt the attack on Syria was imminent.

<b>                                                      The Russian Solution</b>

We are going to have to wait and see if this thing is for real, but at least we haven't dropped a bomb yet, and that is because Secretary of State John Kerry gave a speech last week in which he described chemical attacks in Syria as "obscenit[ies]” which defy our national and international "moralities". Them definitely sound like fighting words. Kerry's speech on Syria was forceful and emotional, sounding like a seasoned general explaining the reasons for his orders. The Washington Post called it at a "a war speech."

Now war may be avoided because in an answer to the question of what the Syrian government could do to avert a U.S. attack, Kerry almost sarcastically said that Syria could avoid the strike by placing their chemical weapons under international control. "He isn't about to [do that],"Kerry said immediately following. U.S. officials, in the wake of Kerry's quip, said the comment was not intended to be a diplomatic opening, but it became one. Kerry’s Russian and Syrian colleagues acted as if it was a real olive branch, and while Kerry was on his way back to the United States to continue banging the war drum, the Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lazarov issued the following statement.

“We are calling on the Syrian authorities [to] not only agree on putting chemical weapons storages under international control but also for its further destruction and then joining the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons,” Lavrov said. He continued, “[w]e have passed our offer to [Syrian Foreign Minister] Walid al-Moualem and hope to receive a fast and positive answer.” Moualem, already in Russia, said Syria “welcomes Russia’s initiative, based on the Syrian government’s care about the lives of our people and security of our country.” Boom, a possible path to peace through Moscow was born.

The Russian offer came quick, before Kerry's plane could have touched back down on U.S. soil. The quickness of such diplomatic action by an uneasy ally is likely based on the severity of possible U.S. strikes. Notice how in his op-ed piece in the New York Times, Putin deemed Obama trustworthy, and Obama is saying he's about to get in that Syrian ass to get them to stop using chemical weapons on innocent people.

Top brass progressive Democrats in Washington like Dianne Feinstein have already began floating the idea of Russia overseeing Syria's surrender of their chemical weapons as the right course of action. Internationally, news of Russia's intervention has been positively received by U.N. Secretary General Ban Ki-moon, British Prime Minister David Cameron, French Foreign Minister Laurant Fabius, and German Chancellor Angela Merkel.

Securing Syria’s toxic arsenal won’t be easy, and even if diplomats reach an agreement, eliminating Syria's chemical weapons stockpile could take years. It is going to be difficult to convince Russia to both: make the resolution militarily enforceable, as well as to enforce Syria's government to take the blame for the Aug. 21 chemical attack. Those responsible, according to international law, should be tried before an international criminal court. Obama knows this is no easy task, and that this Russian plan came together hastily based on his readiness to go hard. Anyone remember those Somali Pirates he had taken out with one shot? That's why he cautiously told Americans Russia holds "the potential to remove the threat of chemical weapons" in Syria, but he also declared the U.S. military will "be ready to respond" against Assad if the measure fails.

We will find out very soon what happens. If this new diplomatic offering by Russia is only an excuse for Syria to buy more time and fool the international community, Obama will not wait long. The President is in no mood to give  credit for this rough situation back to Assad, a man who is waging a brutal war on his own people, having killed thousands, and displaced millions, or to the gay bashing Putin, unless he necessarily has to. They will get the credit however, if the offer is real, and Russia can get Syria to agree to a reasonable time line of turning over their chemical weapons. If that's done, it was likely Obama's willingness to threaten Syria, which led to a peaceful resolution. USA!

Of course, unfortunately, the whole thing could go majorly fucking wrong as well.
